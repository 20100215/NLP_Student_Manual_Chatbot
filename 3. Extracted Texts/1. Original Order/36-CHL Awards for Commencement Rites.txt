Topic 35: CHL Awards for Commencement Rites

For a student to be given the CHL award during the commencement rites, the following should be strictly observed: First, the student must have a GPA of at least 1.7 every semester, for his/her entire residency in a program. NSTP grade is excluded from the computation of the GPA. Practicum/ Internship/ OJT will be included in the computation of the GPA provided that the department considers it as an academic course and the department has obtained prior approval from the VPAA. Second, the distribution of percentage per component is 70% Scientia, 15% Virtus and 15% Devotio. Lastly, the final CHL computation for graduation honors is the average of the CHL grade of every semester.
