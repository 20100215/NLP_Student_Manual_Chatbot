Topic 54: Additional Enrollment Steps for Returnee

Below are the guidelines for returnees. A returnee is a student who has not enrolled in his/her program for at least a semester and has not transferred to another university.  After 2 consecutive semesters, the ISMIS account of such student is deactivated. 

To re-activate your ISMIS account, send an email to comptroller's office informing the office that you are a returnee and would like to seek clearance from the accounting office. If you are an international student, seek clearance from the Office of External Relations & Internationalization. Send an email to Office of Registrar for review and endorsement and contact the department chair for certification of reacceptance. Once acknowledged, submit the clearances and the certificate of reacceptance to the Office of Registrar via email. Upon approval, the registrar staff updates your ISMIS account accordingly and you can proceed to non-block sectioning enrollment.
