Topic 56: Additional Enrollment Steps for Returnee-Shiftee

Below are the guidelines for returnee-shiftees.  A returnee may have been advised to shift / may decide to shift to another program after stopping for at least a semester without transferring to another university. After 2 consecutive semesters, the ISMIS account of such student is deactivated. 

To reactivate your ISMIS account, send first an email to comptroller's office informing the office that you are a returnee-shiftee and would like to seek clearance from the accounting office. If you are an international student, seek clearance from the Office of External Relations. Then contact the previous chair to settle any accountabilities with the department. Next, send an email to Office of Registrar for review and endorsement. Once done, contact the new department chair for certificate of acceptance. Submit the clearances and the certificate of acceptance to the Office of Registrar via email. Your ISMIS account will be updated by the Office of Registrar accordingly.

Once your ISMIS account is reactivated, proceed to non-block sectioning enrollment steps. Surrender your old RFID to OSFA office, and pay 250 pesos for reprinting and proceed to ID room and bring your blue slip from OSFA and OR for your new RFID.
