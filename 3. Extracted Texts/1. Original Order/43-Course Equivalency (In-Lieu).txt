Course equivalency, or in-lieu, is an enrollment option available to all students. Any student can apply for this request. This request becomes necessary when the original course is not offered but there is another course with different descriptive title but the same course content and academic units in a different program offered by the same department or a program of another department.

To apply for course equivalency, go to "Student Task", "Others", and "Application for Course Equivalency". In the form, select first the course outside the prospectus you are requesting to be considered as an equivalent course, then select the course equivalent in current prospectus. Once done, click the "click to add course equivalency item" button to add the course. The previous steps can be repeated if you are applying for course equivalency for more than one course. Click "Submit" once you have encoded all the courses you want to apply for equivalency. You may monitor your status at "Application History" which includes chair for endorsement, course custodian for endorsement, dean for endorsement, and registrar for approval.

Once approved, the registrar staff will be the one to advise the course. If you can still access the enrollment module, you can now choose a schedule by clicking "Enroll". Otherwise, registrar staff will be the one to enroll you to the course.
