The University’s Catholic identity is embodied in two statements, Education with a Mission and Witness to the Word. USC aims at the holistic formation of the individual that enlightens the mind, hones skills, and positively transforms character and behavior (from Dialogue with the Word, SVD Education Ministry as Mission of Dialogue, 2010, 103–104). Every Carolinian becomes a catalyst towardsthe realization of the kingdom of God, promoting truth, love, justice, freedom, peace, and grace. Carolinians in society have a sense of mission recognizable by their contribution as the “light,” “salt,” and “yeast” of the Gospel. Graduates of USC are professionally competent and skilled (Scientia), have noble character and are value-driven (Virtus), and are dedicated to social transformation (Devotio).

VISION 

The University of San Carlos sees: 
• a WORLD where the darkness of sin and the night of unbelief vanish before the light of the Word and the Spirit of grace

 • what they know, they apply justly and honestly;
 • what they do not know, they seek to learn;
 • what they do not have, they endeavor to acquire;
 • what they have, they share.
