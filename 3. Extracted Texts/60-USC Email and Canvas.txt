Students can now use their USC Google Workspace account. Kindly take note of the following:

1. Students email convention is idnumber@usc.edu.ph (e.g. 12345@usc.edu.ph). Use this complete email address when logging in. Your default password is lastname + your idnumber (e.g. delacruz12345). Once logged in, kindly create a recovery email so that you can reset your password anytime in case you forget.

2. Gmail will automatically ask you to change your password but just in case, set up a recover email:
Step 1: Go to "Manage your Google account".
Step 2: Personal Info.
Step 3: Contact Info.
Step 4: Recovery Email.

3. Please use the official USC Google account responsibly and in accordance with Google Workspace for Education Terms of Service.
