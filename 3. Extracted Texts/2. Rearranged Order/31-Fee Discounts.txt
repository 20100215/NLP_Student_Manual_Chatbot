The two fee discounts available for students during enrollment are Family and Sibling Discount and Full Payment Discount.

Family and Sibling Discount is available for siblings enrolled in USC. A student may enjoy a 5% discount on tuition fees except for the sibling/s enrolled in Montessori, Law, and Graduate Programs. To apply for Family and Sibling Discount, click "Student Task", "Others", and "Apply Same Family Privilege". Click the home icon and indicate academic period and year, then indicate the ID number of the sibling to be included in the privilege, then click "Submit". The application is then forwarded to VP Finance for approval whose status can be monitored.

Full Payment Discount is available for a student who wishes to pay for his or her enrolled courses in full. As a general guideline, discount rates are applied based on how the payment was made. For Offsite Payment Centers and Onsite Cash, a 5% discount on tuition fees is granted. For Onsite Credit Card(Visa or Mastercard), a 3% discount on tuition fees is granted. For Onsite Debit Card, a 3.5% discount on tuition fees is granted. You can contact the Accounting Office for verification and the necessary computations.
