Topic 7: Admission

The academic admission requirements are dependent on the status of the applicant student, the program he/she wishes to enroll in, and the requirements set by the different schools/departments. Program-specific requirements may be obtained from the respective school/department or the University Office of Recruitment and Admissions (ORA). The University reserves the right to refuse the admission of any applicant whose qualifications do not meet the standards and requirements of the program and/or of the School/Department. Likewise, the University may refuse the admission of an applicant who has made an intentional misrepresentation/misdeclaration or falsification of submitted documents. Students graduating from senior high school who want to enroll in the University as well as tertiary students who want to transfer to the University must take the College Admission Examinations (CAE).

Policy of Inclusion 

The University adopts, as a matter of policy, inclusive education. In accordance with the UNESCO Policy Guidelines, it supports and welcomes diversity amongst all learners from ethnic and linguistic minorities, rural populations, those affected by HIV and AIDS, and those with disabilities and difficulties in learning by providing equitable access to learning and opportunities to harness their potential as Lifelong Learners. The University commits to eliminating exclusion that is a consequence of negative attitudes and a lack of appropriate University response to diversity in gender, sexual orientation, race, economic status, social class, ethnicity, language, religion, and ability.
