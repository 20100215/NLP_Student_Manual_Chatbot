Topic 9: Admission Steps for International Students

An international student refers to an applicant who undertakes all or part of his/her higher education experience in a country other than his/her home country or an applicant who travels across a national boundary to a country other than his/her home country to undertake all or part of his/her higher education experience.

A student with an international passport or has dual citizenship, or is a Filipino graduate abroad, needs to go through pre-admission process with the External Relations and Internationalization Office (ERIO). The applicant needs to submit additional documents during the admission process before the applicant can proceed with the enrollment process.

The first part is pre-admission, which involves uploading your admission requirements in ISMIS. Go to the International Student Portal through https://ismis.usc.edu.ph/ApplyForeign. Fill out the Personal Data Sheet and complete all fields. Attach the required documents one by one. For every file, click the "Start Upload" button to upload the file. Complete the Captcha and click the "Submit button". ERIO will verify the pre-admission documents and endorse the applicant to the Office of the University Registrar. The Office of the University Registrar will verify the application and endorse the applicant for admission to the Office of the Recruitment and Admissions (ORA).

The required documents for Undergraduate Program Freshmen International Applicants are:
- Transcript of Records (1st and 2nd semesters of Grade 11 and Grade 12) for Bachelorâ€™s Program (IGCSE/GCSE with A-Levels may also be considered)
- Diploma/Certificate of graduation in Grade 12 (Senior High School)
- Photocopy of Passport bio-page with at least two-year validity
- English Proficiency Requirement with a rating in 6.0 in IELTS or at least 60 for TOEFL or as prescribed by the program.

- Proof of Philippine Citizenship for Dual Citizen Applicants such as Philippine Passport, Identification Certificate (IC), or Certificate of Reacquisition/Retention of Philippine Citizenship (CRPC).

The required documents for Masteral and Doctoral Program International Applicants are:
- Baccalaureate Diploma or its equivalent with remarks of graduation
