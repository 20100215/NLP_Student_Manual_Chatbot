Topic 40: CHL Rationale and Aims

In view of the Mission and Vision of the University of San Carlos that aims to develop competent and socially responsible professionals and life long learners in an environment that foster excellence in the academic core processes of teaching-learning, research, and community extension service, the Carolinian Honors List (CHL) replaces the traditional Dean’s List. Those students who qualify to the Carolinian Honors List exhibit the core values of integrity, excellence, commitment, social responsibility, evangelization and leadership. The students in the CHL are assessed, determined, and selected every semester.

The CHL aims the following: 
a) identify students who embody the Carolinian identity, that of being a Witness to the Word. This identity is gauged by the three criteria of Scientia, Virtus, and Devotio. 
b) recognize students in the University who follow the Carolinian path, possess life skills and values.

Scientia refers to academic excellence where one demonstrates competence and skills in one’s chosen discipline. Virtus is good moral conduct, including active participation in school activities and student organizations. Devotio is involvement in the community extension activities outside of the University. Thus, students are encouraged to exercise citizenship in the University by participating in and getting involved in mandatory/required activities, and volunteering in community extension activities in and outside of the campus. These activities are found in the Carolinian Lifestyle Guide (CLG) and are subject to periodic changes.
