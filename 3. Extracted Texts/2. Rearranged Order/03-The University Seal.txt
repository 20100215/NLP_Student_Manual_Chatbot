Topic 3: The University Seal

The University seal is the official insignia of the University of San Carlos. It depicts a shield on either side by seven laurel leaves. The laurel leaves stand for excellence, and each one symbolizes a gift of the Holy Spirit: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. 

The shield is divided into three parts. On the upper left of the shield is a globe encircled and topped by a cross. This is the symbol of the SVD in the world. 

On the upper right part of the shield is Magellanâ€™s Cross, which symbolizes Cebu City, where USC is located. 

On the bottom half of the shield is an open book, which symbolizes knowledge, education, and the Word of God. Above the book are three starts that represent the three major island groups of the Philippines: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
