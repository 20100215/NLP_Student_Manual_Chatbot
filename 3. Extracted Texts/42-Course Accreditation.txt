For accreditation of courses taken from previous schools or program, this is applicable for courses taken by a student from his/her previous local or international school or from his/her previous program within USC with a different course code. If such request is approved, the student does not necessarily have to enroll in such courses. 

To apply for course accreditation, click "Student Task", "Others", and "Apply Course Accreditation". In the form, type the course taken from previous school, or choose from the drop down list the course code from your previous program within USC. Next indicate the equivalent course applied for and upload all the relevant attachments such as course syllabus, prospectus, and grades before submitting. You may monitor your status at "Application history" which includes the evaluator for document assessment, course custodian for accreditation approval, dean for approval, and evaluator for encoding of the accredited course in the system. 

To view accredited courses: click "Student Task", "Enrollment Related", and "View Grades". Scroll down and will find the accredited courses at the bottom part of the list.
