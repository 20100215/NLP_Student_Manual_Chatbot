Topic 25: Sanctions

Pursuant to the Manual of Regulations for Private Higher Education, the following disciplinary sanctions for Serious Offenses or violations of school regulations may be applied to an erring student:

Suspension is a penalty in which the school is allowed to deny or deprive an erring student of attendance in classes for a period not exceeding 20% of the prescribed class days for the term. The decision of the school in every case involving the penalty of suspension which exceeds 20% of the prescribed school days for a term shall be forwarded to the CHED Regional Office within 10 days from the termination of the investigation of each case.

Preventive Suspension of the student under investigation may be imposed even before the hearing of his/her case has commenced. The respondent is not permitted inside the school premises if there is strong evidence of guilt and the moral conviction of the Discipline Committee that the continued stay or presence is a risk or an imminent danger to life and property in school. The preventive suspension shall not exceed 10% of the prescribed school days.
