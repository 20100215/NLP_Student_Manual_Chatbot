Topic 4: History

The University of San Carlos, administered by the Divine Word Missionaries of the SVD, is a university with a very long history that parallels the growth and development of Cebu in central Philippines. The University of San Carlos is historically linked to a small colegio established in honor of San Ildefonso by the Jesuit priests Antonio Sedeño, Alonso de Humanes, Mateo Sanchez, and a lay brother Gaspar Garay on 21 August 1595. The Colegio de San Ildefonso was closed in 1769 because of the papal expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain and all Spanish possessions in 1767.

Ten years later, in 1779, the ownership of the colegio and its propertieswas transferred to the Bishop of Cebu, Msgr. Rubio de Arevalo. Hepaved the way for its re-establishment as the Real Seminario de San Carlos, manned by secular priests. Following the decision of the Bishop of Cebu, Msgr. Romualdo Jimeno, the Dominicans took over as regents. In 1852, the Dominican priests renamed the school Seminario Conciliar de San Carlos.

When the Vincentians took over in 1867, the school offered classes to interns (seminarians) and externs (non-seminarians) to accommodate the local residents’ petition. Thus, it became Seminario-Colegio de San Carlos. In 1894, the Seminario-Colegio de San Carlos conferred the Bachelor’s degree to its first graduates; among them was Sergio Osmeña, later the fourth president of the Philippines from 1944-1946.

At the outbreak of the Filipino Revolution against Spain in 1898, the school closed and later re-opened when American rule began. In 1911, the school was incorporated as Colegio de San Carlos under rector Jacinto Villalain. By 1922, the school was separated from the seminary although it operated on the same campus along Calle Martires (now M. J. Cuenco Avenue). In 1930, the Colegio de San Carlos transferred to its present site along P. del Rosario Street.

In 1935, the Colegio de San Carlos was placed under the German religious order Societas Verbi Divini (SVD). Between 1935 and 1940, the SVD priests and brothers changed Colegio de San Carlos into a truly secular college with the addition of two new colleges aside from the existing College of Liberal Arts: Law and Commerce. The College of Education followed in 1938 and the College of Engineering in 1939.

The Colegio would have been a university, were it not for World War II. Instead, the war brought the Colegio to its knees, leaving its building in ruins with many of its priests and lay killed in the run-up to Liberation. Undaunted, the Colegio was re-opened in June 1945 by Father Josef Jaschik and Father Ernest Hoerdemann. Father Arthur Dingman, the first SVD rector, returned and appointed Father Hoerdemann to oversee a ten-year reconstruction plan, 1947-1957. In 1947, the College of Pharmacy was added.

On 1 July 1948, the Colegio was granted university status by the government. The new University of San Carlos became a university in the real sense of the word with a steady trickle of priest-scholars who left Fu Jen Catholic University of Beijing, China due to the communist take-over. Their research activities in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, anthropology, and archaeology raised the status of the University to a research institution.

In 1956, a new campus for boys was opened along Gen. Maxilom Avenue (presently, the North Campus). In 1962, another campus for grade school boys and girls, for high school girls, and for teachers-to-be was also inaugurated on J. Alcantara Street (now called South Campus).

In 1957, the University became one of the 11 (eleven) charter members of the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities (PAASCU) after being judged worthy of accreditation by a separate committee formed by the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP).

With foresight, the University administrators opened yet another campus in Talamban in 1963 with the construction of the first and only Coconut Chemical Plant in the country, a joint project of the German and Philippine governments. The Talamban campus, home of the College of Engineering and Architecture, became known as the Technological Center by 1965.

The Talamban venture proved fortuitous as the congestion in downtown Cebu prodded the University to develop the nearly 80 hectares of open space into a modern campus. These edifices rose and their curricular programs and service support grew dynamically: 
- Arnoldus Science Building and Talamban Campus Dormitories (1981)
- Retreat and Seminar House (1982)
- Anselmo Bustos Multi-Purpose Hall (1983), Church of Talamban (1985) later dedicated as the Church of St. Arnold and St. Joseph
- Science and Mathematics Education Building which is an annex edifice to the Arnoldus Science Building (1997)
- Maintenance and Calibration Workshop (1998)
- Arts and Sciences Building (1999) later named as Philip van Engelen Building, Health Sciences Building for the College of Nursing and the College of Pharmacy (2004)
- General Services Building and the College of Architecture and Fine Arts Building (2005)
- Engineering Conference Center later named as the Michael Richartz Building (2008)
- Executive House (2008)
- covered courts (2012)
- new dormitories (2012)
- Josef Baumgartner Learning Resource Center (2012)

Currently, the campus is undergoing massive landscaping and face-lifting to enhance the academic environment.

The Downtown Campus has also been going through massive infrastructure development. The Arts Division of the College of Arts and Sciences transferred to Talamban Campus in 2009. Since then, the following structures have been constructed: Law and Graduate Business Building (2009), Wrocklage Yard (2010), Carolinian Inn (2011), Kolk’s Nook (2011), and Language Academy (2013).

In more than 75 years of administration by the Societas Verbi Divini (SVD), the University has become a nationally-recognized institution of higher education. The University’s science and technology programs and administrative apparatus were boosted with the Netherlands’ royal government award of a nine-year joint co-financing program under NUFFIC from 1995 to 2004. Since 2001, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has awarded full autonomy status to the University in apt recognition of its more than 100 academic and curricular programs.

Likewise, PAASCU has conferred a Level III accreditation status on several programs. In the national board and bar examinations, the University is consistent in producing topnotchers. The number of topnotchers in government licensure examinations in Accountancy, Architecture, Chemistry, Education, Engineering, Interior Design, Law, Library Science, and Pharmacy continues to grow each year.

In research, aside from its in-house fund, the University is consistently the recipient of major research grants from local and international external agencies. The Commission on Higher Education, the Department of Science and Technology, and to a minor extent, the private industry, have funded some research projects. Two University-generated inventions have patent applications filed in 2011 in the IPOPhl. For research performance in culture and literature, the University’s Cebuano Studies Center was awarded the Region VII Winner for CHED Best Higher Education Research Program in 2009.

The University of San Carlos has taken the lead in central Philippines in embracing the Philippine Educational Reform Agenda: the institution of the K to 12 basic education system, the possible differentiation of higher educational institutions into five types, and the divergence of accreditation programs into those that are national and international.
