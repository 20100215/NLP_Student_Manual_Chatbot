Simultaneous Enrollment is a request to be filed when a student needs to simultaneously enroll the pre-requisite course with the succeeding course for valid reason(s). Simultaneous enrollment means that both the pre-requisite course and the succeeding course will be enrolled together in the same semester. You are eligible to apply for course override if you are a graduating student on the semester you are currently in. Failure in the prerequisite course invalidates the succeeding course even if you get a passing grade for the latter. The system automatically considers it as a failure.

To apply for Simultaneous Enrollment, click “Student Task”, “Enrollment Related”, and “Apply Simultaneous Enrollment”.  In the form, search and select the courses to be enrolled in the current semester, then click “Submit”. You may monitor your status at “Application History” which includes chair for endorsement, dean for endorsement, and registrar for approval. 

Once approved, the registrar staff will be the one to advise the course. If you can still access the enrollment module, you can now choose a schedule by clicking "Enroll". Otherwise, registrar staff will be the one to enroll you to the course.
