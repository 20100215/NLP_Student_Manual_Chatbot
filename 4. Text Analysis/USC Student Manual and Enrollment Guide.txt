TOPIC 1: Description

University of San Carlos (USC) is a Catholic educational institution administered since 1935 by Society of the Divine Word (SVD) missionaries. A University since 1948, USC offers the complete educational package from kindergarten, including a Montessori academy, to graduate school. Learn more about Education with a Mission and how we become Witness to the Word. USC is also referred here as University. 

Rapid growth in the ‘50s saturated the campus near the city center prompting expansion of the University to what was then called the Boys’ High School in 1956 (now North Campus), and in 1964 to the Teacher Education Center and Girls’ High School (now South Campus) and to Talamban Campus. In 2008, the erstwhile SVD Formation Center was transformed into the Montessori Campus. Currently, The University has five campuses. 

The University is one of the most respected higher education institutions in the Philippines. Programs offered have received either Level II or Level III accreditation from the Federation of Accrediting Associations of the Philippines (FAAP), as evaluated by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities (PAASCU). Seven engineering programs are also accredited by the Philippine Technological Council-Accreditation and Certification Board for Engineering and Technology (PTC-ACBET). The Philippine Commission on Higher Education (CHED) also granted Autonomous Status to the University, and designated eight (8) Centers of Excellence (COEs) and twelve (12) Centers of Development (CODs) in USC. USC ranked between 451 to 500 in the QS University Rankings for Asia 2021 and number 7 among the 100 best universities in the Philippines in 2023 per EduRank. The latter ranking is based on research outputs, non-academic prominence, non academic performance and alumni influence. In 2023, USC is among the five universities in the Philippines that have been included in the world ranking by the United Kingdom-based Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) under the 1201-1400 bracket.

Recognized as a research hub in the southern Philippines, USC has drawn in external grants amounting to PHP298M (~USD5.68M) between AY 2018-2021, including the two pandemic-affected years. Internal research grants of over PHP11M have also been awarded from internal funding within the same time period. Research efforts are supported by a print collection of over 200,000 titles and almost 10,000 non-print volumes housed in the University’s Library System, along with subscriptions to Web of Science and Science Direct. USC also publishes three scholarly journals, The Philippine Scientist, the Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society, and Devotio: Journal of Business and Economic Studies. Additional support for researchers are available through offices or committees providing ethics review, intellectual property and innovation and technology support, and animal care and use. Nineteen patents have been filed by the University since 2012, and one start-up company, Green Enviro Management Systems (GEMS), Inc., has been established. 

Student support in the University includes an international students’ office, online enrolment, dormitories, numerous cafes and canteens, and a transport system within Talamban Campus. USC has more than 600 undergraduate and graduate scholars at any given time. Since 2014, USC has been designated as a Donee Institution by the Philippine Council of Non-Governmental Organization Certification (PCNC).


TOPIC 2: Catholic Identity, Vision, Mission, and Core Values

The University's Catholic identity is embodied in two statements, Education with a Mission and Witness to the Word. USC aims at the holistic formation of the individual that enlightens the mind, hones skills, and positively transforms character and behavior (from Dialogue with the Word, SVD Education Ministry as Mission of Dialogue, 2010, 103–104). Every Carolinian becomes a catalyst towardsthe realization of the kingdom of God, promoting truth, love, justice, freedom, peace, and grace. Carolinians in society have a sense of mission recognizable by their contribution as the "light", "salt", and "yeast" of the Gospel. Graduates of USC are professionally competent and skilled (Scientia), have noble character and are value-driven (Virtus), and are dedicated to social transformation (Devotio).

VISION 

The University of San Carlos sees: 
- a WORLD where the darkness of sin and the night of unbelief vanish before the light of the Word and the Spirit of grace
- a SOCIETY where citizens are competent, noble in character, and community-oriented; what they know, they apply justly and honestly; what they do not know, they seek to learn; what they do not have, they endeavor to acquire; what they have, they share.

MISSION 

The University of San Carlos is a Catholic institution of learning that embodies the principles of academic discipline of San Carlos Borromeo and the missionary charism of the Society of the Divine Word (SVD). 

It aims to develop competent and socially responsible professionals and lifelong learners in an environment that fosters excellence in the academic core processes of teaching-learning, research, and community extension service. 

Its mission is to provide timely, relevant, and transformative academic programs responsive to the needs of the local, national, and global communities in a rapidly changing world.

CORE VALUES 

The University Core Values are: Integrity; Excellence; Commitment; Social responsibility; Evangelization; and Leadership, defined as follows: 

Integrity: Carolinians shall reflect in their personal and professional life the ideals of the Catholic university as "an academic community, which, in a rigorous and critical fashion, assists in the protection and advancement of human dignity and of a cultural heritage through research, teaching and extension services to the local, national and international communities" (Apostolic Exhortation Ex Conde Ecclesiae, 1990)

Excellence: Carolinians shall constantly strive to attain the highest standards in their respective fields. 

Commitment: Carolinians shall bear in mind that the ultimate goal of the University is the transformation of communities, especially in the Visayas and Mindanao, through the provision of quality basic and higher education. 

Social Responsibility: Carolinians shall strive to provide themselves and the students an understanding of and effective tools for addressing the prevailing social realities in the country. As far as possible, they shall volunteer their expertise and contribute to effective social and civic programs in the local community, through initiatives organized by themselves, their respective departments and relevant external organizations.

Evangelization: Carolinians shall seek to understand the values and mores of local cultures and enrich them through gospel values and the teachings of the Church. In a privileged manner, they shall, in solidarity with the Philippines Southern Province of the Society of Divine Word, support the missionary apostolate in the Visayas and Mindanao.

Leadership: Carolinians, not only in positions of authority but also in their own personal capacity, shall strive to set the conditions for reflection and learning on their respective educational tasks, both in their departments and in the local community, foster norms of behavior befitting a Witness to the Word and exhibit these norms in their own way of life.


Topic 3: The University Seal

The University seal is the official insignia of the University of San Carlos. It depicts a shield on either side by seven laurel leaves. The laurel leaves stand for excellence, and each one symbolizes a gift of the Holy Spirit: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. 

The shield is divided into three parts. On the upper left of the shield is a globe encircled and topped by a cross. This is the symbol of the SVD in the world. 

On the upper right part of the shield is Magellan’s Cross, which symbolizes Cebu City, where USC is located. 

On the bottom half of the shield is an open book, which symbolizes knowledge, education, and the Word of God. Above the book are three starts that represent the three major island groups of the Philippines: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.


Topic 4: History

The University of San Carlos, administered by the Divine Word Missionaries of the SVD, is a university with a very long history that parallels the growth and development of Cebu in central Philippines. The University of San Carlos is historically linked to a small colegio established in honor of San Ildefonso by the Jesuit priests Antonio Sedeño, Alonso de Humanes, Mateo Sanchez, and a lay brother Gaspar Garay on 21 August 1595. The Colegio de San Ildefonso was closed in 1769 because of the papal expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain and all Spanish possessions in 1767.

Ten years later, in 1779, the ownership of the colegio and its propertieswas transferred to the Bishop of Cebu, Msgr. Rubio de Arevalo. Hepaved the way for its re-establishment as the Real Seminario de San Carlos, manned by secular priests. Following the decision of the Bishop of Cebu, Msgr. Romualdo Jimeno, the Dominicans took over as regents. In 1852, the Dominican priests renamed the school Seminario Conciliar de San Carlos.

When the Vincentians took over in 1867, the school offered classes to interns (seminarians) and externs (non-seminarians) to accommodate the local residents’ petition. Thus, it became Seminario-Colegio de San Carlos. In 1894, the Seminario-Colegio de San Carlos conferred the Bachelor’s degree to its first graduates; among them was Sergio Osmeña, later the fourth president of the Philippines from 1944-1946.

At the outbreak of the Filipino Revolution against Spain in 1898, the school closed and later re-opened when American rule began. In 1911, the school was incorporated as Colegio de San Carlos under rector Jacinto Villalain. By 1922, the school was separated from the seminary although it operated on the same campus along Calle Martires (now M. J. Cuenco Avenue). In 1930, the Colegio de San Carlos transferred to its present site along P. del Rosario Street.

In 1935, the Colegio de San Carlos was placed under the German religious order Societas Verbi Divini (SVD). Between 1935 and 1940, the SVD priests and brothers changed Colegio de San Carlos into a truly secular college with the addition of two new colleges aside from the existing College of Liberal Arts: Law and Commerce. The College of Education followed in 1938 and the College of Engineering in 1939.

The Colegio would have been a university, were it not for World War II. Instead, the war brought the Colegio to its knees, leaving its building in ruins with many of its priests and lay killed in the run-up to Liberation. Undaunted, the Colegio was re-opened in June 1945 by Father Josef Jaschik and Father Ernest Hoerdemann. Father Arthur Dingman, the first SVD rector, returned and appointed Father Hoerdemann to oversee a ten-year reconstruction plan, 1947-1957. In 1947, the College of Pharmacy was added.

On 1 July 1948, the Colegio was granted university status by the government. The new University of San Carlos became a university in the real sense of the word with a steady trickle of priest-scholars who left Fu Jen Catholic University of Beijing, China due to the communist take-over. Their research activities in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, anthropology, and archaeology raised the status of the University to a research institution.

In 1956, a new campus for boys was opened along Gen. Maxilom Avenue (presently, the North Campus). In 1962, another campus for grade school boys and girls, for high school girls, and for teachers-to-be was also inaugurated on J. Alcantara Street (now called South Campus).

In 1957, the University became one of the 11 (eleven) charter members of the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities (PAASCU) after being judged worthy of accreditation by a separate committee formed by the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP).

With foresight, the University administrators opened yet another campus in Talamban in 1963 with the construction of the first and only Coconut Chemical Plant in the country, a joint project of the German and Philippine governments. The Talamban campus, home of the College of Engineering and Architecture, became known as the Technological Center by 1965.

The Talamban venture proved fortuitous as the congestion in downtown Cebu prodded the University to develop the nearly 80 hectares of open space into a modern campus. These edifices rose and their curricular programs and service support grew dynamically: 
- Arnoldus Science Building and Talamban Campus Dormitories (1981)
- Retreat and Seminar House (1982)
- Anselmo Bustos Multi-Purpose Hall (1983), Church of Talamban (1985) later dedicated as the Church of St. Arnold and St. Joseph
- Science and Mathematics Education Building which is an annex edifice to the Arnoldus Science Building (1997)
- Maintenance and Calibration Workshop (1998)
- Arts and Sciences Building (1999) later named as Philip van Engelen Building, Health Sciences Building for the College of Nursing and the College of Pharmacy (2004)
- General Services Building and the College of Architecture and Fine Arts Building (2005)
- Engineering Conference Center later named as the Michael Richartz Building (2008)
- Executive House (2008)
- covered courts (2012)
- new dormitories (2012)
- Josef Baumgartner Learning Resource Center (2012)

Currently, the campus is undergoing massive landscaping and face-lifting to enhance the academic environment.

The Downtown Campus has also been going through massive infrastructure development. The Arts Division of the College of Arts and Sciences transferred to Talamban Campus in 2009. Since then, the following structures have been constructed: Law and Graduate Business Building (2009), Wrocklage Yard (2010), Carolinian Inn (2011), Kolk’s Nook (2011), and Language Academy (2013).

In more than 75 years of administration by the Societas Verbi Divini (SVD), the University has become a nationally-recognized institution of higher education. The University’s science and technology programs and administrative apparatus were boosted with the Netherlands’ royal government award of a nine-year joint co-financing program under NUFFIC from 1995 to 2004. Since 2001, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has awarded full autonomy status to the University in apt recognition of its more than 100 academic and curricular programs.

Likewise, PAASCU has conferred a Level III accreditation status on several programs. In the national board and bar examinations, the University is consistent in producing topnotchers. The number of topnotchers in government licensure examinations in Accountancy, Architecture, Chemistry, Education, Engineering, Interior Design, Law, Library Science, and Pharmacy continues to grow each year.

In research, aside from its in-house fund, the University is consistently the recipient of major research grants from local and international external agencies. The Commission on Higher Education, the Department of Science and Technology, and to a minor extent, the private industry, have funded some research projects. Two University-generated inventions have patent applications filed in 2011 in the IPOPhl. For research performance in culture and literature, the University’s Cebuano Studies Center was awarded the Region VII Winner for CHED Best Higher Education Research Program in 2009.

The University of San Carlos has taken the lead in central Philippines in embracing the Philippine Educational Reform Agenda: the institution of the K to 12 basic education system, the possible differentiation of higher educational institutions into five types, and the divergence of accreditation programs into those that are national and international.


Topic 5: University Saints

The three university saints are San Carlos Borromeo (1538-1584), St. Arnold Janssen (1837-1909), St. Joseph Freinademetz (1852-1908).

SAN CARLOS BORROMEO (1538-1584) 

Although USC is owned and managed by the Society of Divine Word (SVD), its name is carved after a saint who was not a member of this religious congregation. St. Charles Borromeo, whose feast falls on November 4, was born to a noble family which had produced, among others, such persons as Pope Pius IV, during whose leadership Charles became the first Cardinal of Romagna and then, at twenty-two, the Archbishop of Milan. He was an influential churchman in his time, facilitating the final deliberations of the Council of Trent and taking a large share in the drafting of the Tridentine Catechism. He bravely attended to the sick and the dead victims of the plague, sparing no expense and avoiding no danger in an effort to assist the poor. He played a major role against the reformation movement. Most relevant for this biographical sketch is his series of activities toward reform of the collegiate churches, seminaries, colleges, and communities for the education, especially of candidates for holy orders. At present, many Catholic schools and parishes all over the world are named after him, including the Seminario Mayor de San Carlos in Cebu, Philippines. This makes him a Patron of Seminaries, the reason why his name was adopted when the diocese took over the school for clerical candidates in 1783. The Colegio used to be attached to the Seminario, but legal considerations necessitated that it became an autonomous entity, a secular school from which evolved the University of San Carlos. St. Charles Borromeo is rightly venerated as a saint of learning and the arts, a reformist whose opinion was sought by both sovereign and pope.

ST. ARNOLD JANSSEN (1837-1909) 

St. Arnold Janssen (1837-1909) is the founder of the Society which now owns and manages the University of San Carlos, the Society of Divine Word (SVD), a missionary congregation of more than 6,000 brothers and priests spread all over the world, which is now the fastest growing religious male congregation in the Catholic Church. Unlike San Carlos Borromeo, St. Arnold Janssen came from a simple family of eleven children in the village of Goch in the Rhineland, Germany, not far from the Dutch border. Intellectually-endowed and keen on science and theology, he went through the usual formation of a priest.

As a young priest, he became a school teacher of the natural sciences and mathematics in Bocholt and, as a devotee to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he was named Diocesan Director for the Apostleship of Prayer. This devotion likewise inspired him to engage in media work as a form of missionary activity, especially through the circulation of a devotional magazine, The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart. St. ArnoldJanssen is what one might call an accidental religious founder, imbued with a vision and forced by circumstances to undertake the foundation of a missionary congregation out of obedience to his Bishop, during the difficult days of the Kulturkampf in 1875. He knew that the whole project would collapse without God’s blessings. From zero, the congregation grew to its present size like the proverbial mustard seed. 

Today, the SVD missionary world is divided into 4 zones: Asia-Pacific (ASPAC), Africa-Madagascar (AFRAM), America (PANAM) and Europe (EUROPA). In his lifetime, too, St. Arnold became providentially the founder of two congregations of missionary sisters: the Sisters of the Holy Spirit (SSpS), fondly called the Blue Sisters, and the contemplative Sisters of the Holy Spirit of Perpetual Adoration (SSpSAP), better known as the Pink Sisters. The first missionaries were sent by the Founder to China and the last missionaries, he commissioned to the Philippines, setting foot in Abra in 1909, just before he breathed his last. St. Arnold Janssen is a model not only of a missionary but also of a leader or what is now called a manager or corporate executive officer. Definitely, he was ahead of his time in his use of communication and media; he was truly a holy and dialogical founder, leader, and father.

ST. JOSEPH FREINADEMETZ (1852-1908) 

St. Joseph Freinademetz (1852-1908) was one of the first two missionaries sent outside of Germany. In fact, it was his desire to do a mission in China that attracted the young priest to go to Steyl. Fr. Joseph was born in Oies, a small hamlet in the Dolomite Alps of northern Italy, in the region known as South Tyrol, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. While studying Theology at the diocesan seminary of Brixen, he began to think seriously of foreign missions as a way of life.

As a young priest of only three years, who had already won the hearts of his parishioners, he asked permission from his Bishop to join the missionary community in Steyl, Holland. After some years of rigorous formation, on 2 March 1879, he received the mission Cross and, together with Fr. Anzer departed Europe for China. Fr. Joseph Freinademetz was a missionary par excellence. The years in South Shantung were hard years, marked by long, arduous journeys, assaults by bandits, and the difficult work of forming the first Christian communities. He learned the lesson of enculturation the hard way and became a true model of a Witness to the Word.

A missionary with a traditional outlook, when he first set foot on China, he thought of himself as imbued with a call to convert people to his religion; he soon discovered that mission was actually a humbling experience of self conversion. His whole life became an effort to become a Chinese among Chinese, so much so that his words are still heard today: "I love China and the Chinese. I want to die among them and be laid to rest among them." He is reputed to have expressed the desire "to be a Chinese even in heaven." Together with the Founder, Fr. Arnold Janssen, he was beatified by Pope Paul VI on 19 October 1975 and canonized by Pope John Paul II on 5 October 2003.

Step 3: Pay the down payment of Php 3,000.00 through the most convenient payment channels which can be accessed in this website: https://www.usc.edu.ph/updated-payment-channels. For scholars, they need to request for the endorsement letter from the Office of Alumni Affairs, Scholarships and Job Placement (OAASJP) and the OAASJP will email it to assessmenttertiary@usc.edu.ph to bypass or override the down payment. If the applicant is unable to enroll after 2 to 3 banking days of paying the down payment, send a proof of payment to offsitecol@usc.edu.ph.

Step 4: Log in to the ISMIS portal with the website https://ismis.usc.edu.ph/ using the given username and the set password.

Step 5: In the ISMIS portal, click "Student Task", "Enrollment Related", and "Student Enrollment" and proceed with either block enrollment or non-block enrollment depending on the period set during the day the enrollment module is accessed. For concerns, contact the department chair.

Step 5: Print the study load by clicking "Student Task", "Enrollment Related", and "View Study Load" and click the Print button. 

Step 6:  Proceed to the IRMO ID Room (either at the Downtown or Talamban Campus) for picture taking. The School ID will only be released upon the presentation of the clearance from the Office of the University Registrar. For concerns on this step, please email irmoacs@usc.edu.ph.

As soon as classes start, students are automatically enrolled in the CANVAS Learning Management System (LMS) to receive announcements and updates of the courses they are enrolled in as well as through the USC emails of the students. If there are no notifications received, you may email irmoacs@usc.edu.ph to request for an update.


Topic 16: Enrollment Mechanics

Every applicant student must enroll during the prescribed registration period. Detailed instructions on online enrollment procedures are in ISMIS and the official USC website. Enrollment by proxy is not allowed. Enrollment is done in the ISMIS portal. The link for the ISMIS portal is https://ismis.usc.edu.ph.

Integrated School Management Information System (ISMIS) refers to the portal for USC students, faculty, and staff. It is a repository of pertinent school information. Officially enrolled students can view grades, class schedules, application for student requests (withdrawal, program shift, overload, etc.), assessment and enrollment.

When a student registers in USC, it is understood that he/she is enrolling for the entire term.

A student is officially enrolled after he/she has submitted the required documentation requirements at the Office of the University Registrar, has made an initial payment of school fees, and has been issued or has downloaded a validated Study Load that authorizes him/her to attend classes. Upon receipt of the required documents, a clearance form for the USC ID card will be given. 

A student must be officially enrolled in a course to participate in class activities, take quizzes and major exams, and to receive a grade at the end of the semester. His/her name must be reflected on the class list. 

Course refers to a subject offered in a tertiary institution. It is identified by the course title, course code, and course description. Class List is a list of students officially enrolled in a particular course and schedule.

During the enrollment period, a student may change a program upon the endorsement of the Department Chair and School Dean and approval by the Registrar. Changes are not permitted after the close of the enrollment period. 

In general, Cross-enrollment is discouraged. However, for valid reasons, as determined by the Department Chair and the approval of the School Dean, cross-enrollment in another institution may be permitted to graduating students (with a Deficiency Form) of not more than six (6) units during the semester and three (3) units during the summer term, inclusive of the total units enrolled in that particular term. Furthermore, cross-enrollment is not allowed if it is the only remaining course so as not to prejudice the student’s residency in the University. The last course must be taken at the University.

A permit to study in another school with accredited programs may be granted upon the recommendation of the Department Chair and the approval of the School Dean but only for general education courses. Major, professional, or technical courses required for the degree program pursued have to be taken at the University. 

Withdrawal of courses is allowed even after the close of the enrollment period with the endorsement of the Department Chair and School Dean. The Application for withdrawal of course(s) is online in ISMIS under Student Task. Withdrawal of course(s) is not allowed after mid term examinations or after the incurrence of unexcused absences (20% of the total number of required school days). Corresponding charges for withdrawal are stipulated in Section 3.6. 

Transfer of students and transfer credentials. A student who intends to transfer to another school should apply for a Certificate of Transfer Credentials (CTC) online in ISMIS. Such a certificate with the informative copy of the Transcript of Records and other documents will be issued only after the applicant has been cleared of all financial and property liabilities.


Topic 17: Enrollment Timeline

The order of enrollment modes are Block Enrollment, Non-block enrollment, Open Market, and Adjustment Period. The enrollment dates for every term (regular semester and summer) can be found in the academic calendar. 

Commonly, enrollment begins with a block enrollment period for all year students. After a few days, the mode of enrollment shifts to non-block enrollment, first for third to fifth year students, then for first and second year students. The next period is open market, which reservation of courses to specific departments will already be lifted. Here, the student can now see other schedules which may suit him/her better. The final period is adjustment period which the enrollment module will no longer be accessible by the student but instead by the department. Here, there might be changes in your class schedules, rooms, and instructors based on the status of the course. Undersized classes might be dissolved and you have to contact your department for resolutions. Hence, students are advised to monitor their enrollment status during the adjustment period to see for any sudden changes done by the department.

Block sectioning allows a student to enroll all the courses for the term at once. Eligibility: You are eligible for block sectioning if you are enrolling for a regular full load in a given semester. You must not have incurred any failures or NG from the previous semesters. Note that the only way students are eligible for block enrollment is that they obtained passing grades for all courses that are pre-requisite to the set of courses on a given semester. Should this be not met, they have to opt for non-block enrollment instead and enroll only the courses they are eligible in. You are allowed to not fully consume all the units allotted for you in a given semester based on your year level standing.

Non-block sectioning requires the student to advise and enroll a course one at a time. This is available to all students regardless of their course statuses and only after the block enrollment period has ended. During non-block enrollment, the course schedules which the students can view during this period are only those which are reserved to their home department.


Topic 18: Enrollment Steps for Continuing Students

Following are the main steps for enrollment to be done by all continuing students:

Step 1: Log in to your ISMIS account. Go to https://ismis.usc.edu.ph and log-in using your given credentials

Step 2: Go to student enrollment function. Inside the ISMIS portal, click "Student Task", "Enrollment Related", and "Student Enrollment".

Step 3: Settle your accountabilities, if any. Should you receive a pop-up message informing you that you cannot proceed with enrollment, check the content. If it alerts you about down payment, please refer to the amount indicated on your screen. if it alerts you about past dues / balances, please go to "Student Ledger" to view payables. Then pay the specified amount via payment channels and follow the payment instructions indicated. There is no need for continuing students to send proof of payment (such process is only applicable to incoming freshies). To check as to whether payment has been cleared (meaning, USC has received bank confirmation), please go to "Student Task", "Assessment", and click "Student Ledger". If you need clearance from specific offices, go to notifications icon at ISMIS, beside your profile picture by clicking click "View Notifications", then contact each office indicated and request for temporary clearance or unblocking.

Step 4a: For block enrollment, advise and enroll for a block section. Click "Block Advising", then choose your desired Block Section, and then click "Enroll Block Section". Once done, you are now officially enrolled.

Step 4b: For non-block enrollment, advise and enroll the courses one by one. Click "Advise Course", then select from the available schedules. The schedule can be picked only when the slots are not yet full and you do not have conflicts from other courses. Then click "Enroll Course". Repeat until you are able to advise and enroll the courses you are allowed to take for this semester. Note that the reservation of courses to specific departments will be enforced until open market begins where students can begin viewing the other schedules from other departments.

Step 5: Enroll in GE Free Electives. GE Free Electives may not form part of a block section in some programs. You may wish to know which elective courses are offered this semester. To do this inside ISMIS, click the "Student Task" tab, then click "Enrollment Related" from the drop-down list, then click "View Offered Courses", then type in "GE-FEL" and the current academic period and year. During the block and non-block sectioning enrollment period, you will only find GE Free Electives reserved to your department. More options will be available during open market period provided they are not full yet. Once you know which elective course to take, click the "Student Task" tab, then click "Enrollment Related" from the dropdown list, then click "Student Enrollment", then click "Advice Course". Select the rows for free electives e.g. GE-FREELEC 1, then Select from the available schedule and click "Enroll Course".

Step 6: View your study load. Should you wish to view or print your study load, click "Student Task", "Enrollment Related", and "View Study Load". This will serve as your proof of enrollment which will be asked by some of your instructors or in activities that you will be joining as a student.



Topic 19: Enrollment Concerns

If there are no more slots for General Education courses under your department, wait for open market period where you can pick other groups which are from the other departments. Be mindful of the building and room assigned for the schedule.

If there are no more slots for a major course offered by your department, reach out to your program coordinator. We also request the affected students to be patient as the coordinators have to consider the classroom and teacher availability before being able to open another class group for a particular course. Note that during adjustment period, classes with insufficient students will be dissolved so the extra needed groups may be held in those timeslots instead.

Where can I see a list of Programs in USC with their prospectus? To see the list of Programs in the University and the contact details of all Departments, check the Program Owners powerpoint in the Comprehensive Enrollment Guide. A syllabus may be requested from the Department that handles the Program. Only the prospectus of your Program is found in your ISMIS account.

Why has my INC has the override application been disapproved? You may have not properly indicated your course in the application. Students can check their application status by clicking the eye button beside their application form.	

To check your assessment which includes your tuition fees, and other school fees, click "Student task", "Others", then "Assessment". There you can view a breakdown of your dues of the current semester. To access your fees from the previous semesters, adjust the semester and year in the dropdown lists found at the top of the Assessment page. 

To apply for promissory note, go to "Promissory Note" in ISMIS and click "Apply Promissory Note". Note tht this module is only available only within the enrollment period. Choose the option "Enrollment" in the dropdown list if the promissory is for balance for the previous semester. After inputting the installment plan for the outstanding balance, provide the amount and promised date when you would like to settle the amount you have indicated. You may chooose to have 2,3 or 4 installment options to settle the balance depending on your choice. The amount indicated in the installment plan is on top of the current semester's dues. When inputing the amount, do not use comma separators. An interval of at least 30 days must be observed between installment updates. Total installment payment must equal to the balance shown up to the last cent. Note that a student cannot apply for another promissory note if he or she has not settled the balances from the previous promissory note. After applying for promissory note, you still need to pay for the downpayment before you can proceed to enrollment.

Topic 35: Curricular and Non-Curricular Requirements

A student enrolled in a bachelor’s or associate program is considered full-time if he/she carries a regular load prescribed in his/her curriculum for a given time. The curricular year of a student is determined by the number of units earned in the curriculum of his/her program. The course load and sequence of courses shall be in accordance with the approved curriculum. Reasonable exceptions may be permitted in individual cases taking into account the best interest of the students and the objectives of the curriculum as determined by the School Dean or Department Chair. No course(s) can be taken ahead of its/their pre-requisite(s); otherwise, it/they shall be nullified and taken again even if the student is graduating. Laboratory courses should be taken with the corresponding lecture courses in the same semester even though separate grades are earned. In case of withdrawal of co-requisites, both courses should be withdrawn together. A failed co-requisite course can be re-enrolled without re-enrolling the other course the student has passed. All curricular policies, including the sequence of courses, apply to transferees and shiftees. They should not be given preference for override of prerequisites and not opening of off-semester courses. Upon admission, the Chair should inform the students of the number of courses that they can enroll in, especially if some courses need prerequisites. The option for tutorial or petition may be provided for an off-semester course but in no case shall the regular students be allowed to join in and take the course in advance.

Course Adjustments

Application for the following course adjustments is in ISMIS:
OVERLOAD. A student may have an overload of not more than six (6) units in excess of the regular load under the following conditions: 
- graduating at the end of the year; has not incurred more than five (5) failures (a grade of 5.0) in those terms that he/she was enrolled at the university 
- grade point average (GPA) is at least 2.8. In computing the GPA, grades of 5.0 and NC are included. - the excess course(s) is/are not prerequisites. Repeated courses due to failures may be taken as overload if recommended by the Department Chair and the School Dean, and approved by the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA). The overload may be spread in the last two terms.

SIMULTANEOUS ENROLLMENT. A student may be allowed to enroll in the pre-requisite course and the advanced course simultaneously in order to graduate during his/her final term. This privilege is restricted to only a particular two-subject load. Simultaneous enrollment involving three or more advanced courses taken together with corresponding prerequisites are not allowed. If the student fails in the prerequisite(s), he/she would have to retake all the advanced courses affected and the enrollment for the advanced courses automatically becomes null and void. Failure in the prerequisite course invalidates the advanced course enrolled simultaneously. Simultaneous enrollment of an advanced major course with a failed prerequisite course may be allowed starting on the third year of a four-year program and on the fourth year of a five-year program.

PETITIONED/TUTORIAL COURSES. Students may request for the opening of a course as a petitioned or tutorial class (lecture) subject to the following conditions:

- it is a prerequisite course for the next semester offering 
- it is the only course left for the students to graduate at the end of the term 
- there should be at least six (6) students for the petitioned course and five (5) students or less for the tutorial course 
- a laboratory course can only be requested as a petitioned course.

OVERRIDE COURSES. The override rule due to an INC grade of a prerequisite course in favor of an advanced course may be allowed in the last academic year prior to graduation. It may also be allowed for a subsequent course that requires Internship/Practicum as a requisite in case the student is still completing the said Internship/ Practicum (i.e., number of hours required).

Accreditation of Courses. Accreditation should be on the basis of equivalence in course content and level of instruction. Units earned in non-degree programs may be considered for accreditation to a degree program and limited to general education subjects, and if necessary, the student should be subjected to validating examinations. Necessary precautions should be taken in the case of foreign students in accrediting units earned abroad. Furthermore, accreditation of courses shall be based on the curriculum of the programs, in particular, the topic coverage, and the number of units earned or contact hours. It should be accomplished within the enrollment period upon admission to the University through ISMIS, supported by a copy of the official or informative transcript of records signed by the School Registrar or by an official authority, not the grade slips. Accreditation is subject to the following terms and conditions:

For earned units and credits taken from higher education institutions:
- Earned units to be accredited shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total required academic units of the degree program for graduation.
- Only professional courses taken from PAASCU Level III accredited degree programs may be requested for accreditation.
- General Education Courses with a final grade of 2.5 (B- = 80%) or higher can be accredited if taken from PAASCU-accredited degree programs and a final grade of 2.0 (B+ = 85%) or higher if taken from non-PAASCU accredited degree programs. General Education courses taken prior to 2018-2019 are not credited except for Rizal and NSTP. 
- Validating Examinations shall be administered by the Course Chair to students who do not meet the required final grade. 
- Course description and official copy of the transcript of records (TOR) duly signed by the school registrar shall be the bases for accreditation and not grade slips or print-out of grades. For enrollment purposes, the informative copy of the transcript of records would suffice.
- The approved accreditation of courses is subject to revocation if the records upon which the approval is based are later found to be incorrect.

For earned units and credits taken abroad:
- Earned units to be accredited shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total required academic units of the degree program for graduation. 
- Only collegiate courses with a final grade of 2.0 (B = 85%) or higher can be accredited. 
- Validating Examinations shall be administered by the Course Chair to students who do not meet the required final grade and/ or the required units of the course. The approved accreditation of courses is subject to revocation if the records upon which the approval is based are later found to be incorrect.

For earned units and credits in non-degree programs: 
- Only General education Courses taken in AY 2018-2019 onwards with a final grade of 2.5 (B- = 80%) or higher can be accredited if taken from PAASCU accredited degree programs and a final grade of 2.0 (B = 85%) or higher if taken from non-PAASCU accredited degree programs. 
- Validating Examinations shall be administered by the Subject Chairman to students who do not meet the required final grade.
The approved accreditation of courses is subject to revocation if the records upon which the approval is based are later found to be incorrect.

Residency. The student is expected to complete the program within the period specified in the program. The student may avail of the Maximum Allowable Residency (MAR) that is equal to the required number of years to complete the course multiplied by 1.5. This covers the conduct of research/ thesis as part of the program requirement. The admission of students who go beyond MAR is subject to deliberation by the Department/School. It may be a cause for non-readmission.

Leave of Absence. A student who does not intend to enroll during the following semester is required to file a leave of absence for a maximum of one (1) year prior to its effectivity. He/she writes a letter to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, duly endorsed by the Department Chair and School Dean, with a declaration that he/she shall not enroll in any other school for the duration of the leave. Documents such as doctor’s advice for medical reasons may be attached to justify the leave. The approved Leave of Absence copy shall be part of the student’s permanent record in the Office of the University Registrar. An official Leave of Absence is not counted in the Maximum Allowable Residency (MAR) and does not affect the residency of the student who is vying for graduation honors. Failure to file a leave of absence shall have the following effects: 
- The period covered by the student’s absence shall continue to be counted towards his/her Maximum Allowable Residency (MAR). 
- If a new curriculum is implemented during the absence, he/she shall be required to follow the new curriculum on his/her return. 
- The student’s readmission shall be subject to terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Department/School. 
- A student shall be disqualified to graduate with honors since a continuous enrollment is a requirement.

Examinations. Besides regular class quizzes, tests, and other requirements, four (4) official general examinations are required to be given every term: pre-midterm, mid-term, pre-final, and final examinations. Dates for these examinations are posted on USC’s official website. Faculty members are provided with the examination schedule for their information and guidance.

Students are advised to check their grades through their ISMIS account, print the grades, and keep a copy in a folder together with other important documents ready for reference on occasions such as advising, enrollment, graduation, and other activities when evidence of academic performance is needed. The University is authorized to withhold access to grades of students who may have an academic deficiency, are undergoing disciplinary sanction, or have unsettled financial obligations.


Topic 36: General Courses

General Education. As expressly provided in the CHED CMO No. 20, series of 2013, this is the portion of the curriculum common to all undergraduate students regardless of their major. It exposes them to various domains of knowledge and ways of comprehending social and natural realities, developing in the process their intellectual and civic competencies. Students are then required to take interdisciplinary general education courses consisting of 24 units of core courses, 9 units of elective courses, and 3 units on the life and works of Rizal.

Education with a Mission. In addition to the regular curriculum requirements, all students, regardless of nationality, race, religion, culture, beliefs, must take six (6) units of Education with a Mission (EDM) courses. This facilitates understanding and prepares them to assume their role: Witness to the Word.

Physical Education. Students are required to complete eight (8) units of Physical Education (TPE) during their first two (2) years. Simultaneous enrollment in two (2) or more TPE courses in a particular term is not permitted. TPE units are included in the summation of the total study load for the term and in the computation of the grade point average (GPA). Students with particular medical conditions or disabilities may take adapted TPE classes in consultation with the Department of Physical Education.

National Service Training Program.The Implementing Rules and Regulations of National Service Training Program (NSTP) Act of 2001 states that "all incoming freshmen students, male and female, starting school year 2002-2003, enrolled in any baccalaureate program and in at least 2-year technical and vocational or associate course, are required to complete one NSTP component of their choice, as a graduation requirement." It has the following components which the students can choose from: Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), Literacy Training Service (LTS), and Civic Welfare Training Service (CWTS). Each of these components shall be undertaken for an academic period of two (2) semesters; and shall be credited for three (3) units with 54 to 90 training hours each semester. International students, however, are not required to enroll in the NSTP. International students are exempted from taking NSTP.


Topic 37: Academic Performance and Grading System

Attendance. A student who incurs unexcused absences of more than 20% of the prescribed number of class hours or laboratory periods during the term should be given NC or 5.0.

Probation and Retention. If in any term, astudent fails in one-third of the units in which he/she is enrolled, he/she should not re-enroll in the same program without approval from the School Dean and the endorsement of the Department Chair. If the student fails the second time, he/she may enroll in another program if accepted by the Department Chair concerned. A student is disqualified from the University if he/she fails the third time. 

As a general rule, disqualification from the program no longer applies to the third-year level of a four-year program and to the fourth-year level of a five-year program. However, each department may have its own retention policy with the approval of the Vice President for Academic Affairs.

The grading system adopted by the University is as follows:
1.0 is equivalent to 100-95%. 1.1 is equivalent to 94%. 1.2 is equivalent to 93%. 1.3 is equivalent to 92%. 1.4 is equivalent to 91%. 1.5 is equivalent to 90%. 1.6 is equivalent to 89%, 1.7 is equivalent to 88%, 1.8 is equivalent to 87%. 1.9 is equivalent to 86%. 2.0 is equivalent to 85%. 2.1 is equivalent to  84%. 2.2 is equivalent to 83%. 2.3 is equivalent to 82%. 2.4 is equivalent to 81%. 2.5 is equivalent to  80%. 2.6 is equivalent to 79%. 2.7 is equivalent to 78%. 2.8 is equivalent to 77%. 2.9 is equivalent to  76%. 3.0 is equivalent to 75%. And 5.0 is equivalent to below 75%.

A grade of 1.0 is equal to letter grade A+. A grade of 1.1 to 1.3 is equal to letter grade A. A grade of 1.4 to 1.7 is equal to letter grade A-. A grade of 1.7 to 1.9 is equal to letter grade B+. A grade of 2.0 to 2.2 is equal to letter grade B. A grade of 2.3 to 2.5 is equal to letter grade B-. A grade of 2.6-2.8 is equal to letter grade C+. A grade of 2.9 to 3.0 is equal to letter grade C. A grade of 5.0 is equal to C-.

A passing grade is a grade within 1.0 and 3.0. A grade of 5.0 means failure.

Unsatisfactory performance or unexcused absences of more than 20% of the prescribed number of class hours or laboratory periods during the term merits a 5.0 or failure as well.

You need a numeric grade within 1.0 to 3.0 to pass a given course. Take note that it is based solely on the final grade, while the midterm grades are completely irrelevant at this point. For the passing percentage, please revisit the syllabus of your courses or contact your instructors.

If a student gets a 5.0 or NC, it means that he or she has failed the course and therefore needed to retake in the succeeding semester until he or she passes the subject.

INC means incomplete, a grade which indicates that the student has an initial passing grade but has not complied with all the academic requirements or failed to take the final examination for the course due to sickness, emergency cases, or accident. It can also mean a failure to submit a major course requirement. It must be completed within the reasonable period set by the faculty member but not to exceed six (6) months following the semester or summer in which the course was taken; otherwise, the grade automatically becomes "NC" (No Credit).

NC means no credit, a Final grade which does not earn credit nor indicate failure given in those cases where the student did not take the final examination in the course and did not inform the teacher of the reason for failing to take the final examination before the deadline for submission of grades in ISMIS, and his/her performance was not satisfactory to meit a passing grade. Such a grade is permanent and cannot be changed subsequently.

W means withdrawal of enrollment from course/s with official notice.

IP means in Progress, a grade given to students who are still working on their thesis for a maximum of one (1) year. It cannot be used for courses other than thesis. Once they complete their thesis, students will earn a numerical grade.

Computation of Grade Point Average (GPA). The GPA is computed in all curricula by multiplying the number of units assigned to a course by the final grade earned and then by dividing the summation of the products by the total number of units enrolled for the term. Grades of 5.0 and NC of credit courses are, however, included in the GPA calculation. Grade in NSTP is excluded from the computation. Practicum/Internship/OJT will be included in the computation of the GPA provided that the department considers it as an academic course and that the department has obtained prior approval from the VPAA.

Dean’s Honors List. The University recognizes superior scholastic achievement through the Dean’s Honors List per semester of each School/ Department. The qualifications for Dean's Honors List are as follows:
- A regular load for the semester according to the curriculum enrolled.
- A Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 1.70.
- Of good moral character and has not been found guilty of any offenses.
Students in the Dean’s Honors List qualify for the Carolinian Honors List, with Scientia representing 70% of the computation. These are the students with a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 1.0 to 1.7.

Carolinian’s Honors List. In view of the Mission and Vision of the University of San Carlos, whichaims to develop competent and socially responsible professionals and life-long learners in an environment that fosters excellence in the academic core processes of teaching-learning, research, and community extension service, the Carolinian Honors List (CHL) recognizes the holistic achievements of the student in the University.

The CHL aims to identify students who embody the Carolinian identity, that of being a Witness to the Word. This identity is gauged by the three (3) criteria of Scientia, Virtus, and Devotio. The CHL also aims to recognize students in the University who follow the Carolinian path, and possess life skills and values. Scientia refers to academic excellence, where one demonstrates competence and skills in one’s chosen discipline. Virtus is good moral conduct, including active participation in school activities and student organizations. Devotio is involvement in community extension activities outside of the University.

Thus, students are encouraged to exercise citizenship in the University by participating in and getting involved in mandatory/required activities, and volunteering in community extension activities inside and outside of the campus. These activities are in the Carolinian Lifestyle Guide (CLG) and are subject to periodic changes.

The Carolinian Honors are awarded every semester. Students who obtain a CHL average of at least 1.7 will be included in the Carolinian Honors List. A Certificate of Recognition will be awarded in a formal ceremony to be conducted by the School concerned.

The top three (3) ranks of each Cluster will be given a scholarship in the form of a tuition fee discount. If the first in rank of each cluster is already enjoying a full scholarship either by government/private/University sponsorship, the next in line will be given the CHL scholarship. If the student has an existing University scholarship, the one with the higher privilege will be availed. If the student is enjoying a government or private partial scholarship, the CHL privilege will serve as a supplement to cover the difference in tuition fees.


Topic 38: Scholarship, Grants, and Loans

General Guidelines of the Scientia, Virtus, and Devotio Student Financial Assistance Program: The University provides scholarship grants to students characterized by either of the following: scholastic excellence, membership in the USC varsity teams and the USC performing arts groups, and financial status as supported by pertinent documents. Scholarships are likewise afforded to deserving students who meet the requirements of alumni associations, government, and private scholarship benefactors. The scholarship program at USC consists of those sponsored by the University, Alumni, Government, and Private Entities. 

Thus, consistent with the National Government’s thrust (per Uni-FAST Act) and the University Administration's directions, according to the type of Student Financial Assistance, the nomenclatures of student financial assistance privileges are now being rationalized to reflect advocacy of the University’s identity principle "Education with a Mission" and practice of the Carolinians' motto of "Scientia, Virtus & Devotio as provided in the following categories."

Scholarships according to Type of Student Financial Assistance Program (StuFAP):
- Scholarship (Merit/Scientia) – emphasizes excellent academic performance, athletic skills (for Varsity Players), and artistic talents (for the Performing Arts Group, i.e., USC Choristers, USC Dance Troupe & Theater Guild). 
- Grant-in-Aid (Non-Merit/Devotio) – the emphasis is on the long term difficult financial status and needs of the student beneficiary’s family. 
- Loan (Devotio) – considers the financial need at the moment, regardless of the financial status of the student beneficiary’s family.

Scholarships according to Sponsor are the University, SVD-Individuals, Alumni, Faculty Members, USC SSC, Government, and Industry and Private Entities. Scholarships according to levels of education are Graduate, Tertiary, Basic Education, and Senior High School.

As a general rule, scholarship grantees are not allowed multiple scholarships at any given time. But, if there are those qualifying for two are entitled only to the scholarship with the higher financial grant upon the endorsement of the Alumni Affairs, Scholarship and Job Placement Office. However, those who are beneficiaries of a scholarship grant funded by other agencies or by private individuals are entitled to a USC tuition fee discount privilege due to them because of scholastic excellence, i.e., Carolinian Honors List and membership in varsity teams and performing arts groups recognized by the University.

Applicants may inquire about available scholarships and secure forms from the Alumni Affairs, Scholarship and Job Placement Office or Coordinators/Advisers. Scholarship applicants must properly complete forms and specific requirements for submission within the official registration period.


Topic 39: Graduation

The following are the requirements for Graduation: Candidates for graduation are required to apply online in ISMIS for evaluation of their academic records a semester/term before graduation sothat any deficiency can be evaluated. Dates and deadlines for academic evaluation are announced each semester. After evaluating academic records, candidates for graduation should apply online for graduation in ISMIS. Dates and deadlines for the application for graduation are announced each semester. Candidates for graduation are required to accomplish online in ISMIS the clearance for graduation before the final examinations. Their official transcript of records and diplomas will be released when cleared of any financial and property obligations. After the final examinations, application for graduation will no longer be accommodated. The School of Law requires that a candidate’s application for graduation be approved by the Law Faculty and Board of Candidates for Graduation, who shall, among other things, take into consideration the ability of the candidates to pass the Bar Examination. Fines are imposed for late application.

As for Graduation Honors, during the Commencement Rites, both the Latin Honors and Carolinian Honors will be awarded to qualified graduates. For all honors, they must have not committed any infraction and have a Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 1.70.

The GPA for the Standard Latin Honors is computed based on the final grades of all courses taken, except NSTP. A student with a GPA of 1.00 to 1.20 is awarded with Summa Cum Laude which means With Highest Praise. A student with a GPA of 1.21 to 1.45 is awarded with Magna Cum Laude which means With Great Praise. A student with a GPA of 1.46 to 1.70 is awarded with Cum Laude which means With Praise.

The GPA for the Carolinian Honors is computed based on the CHL guidelines and the final grades of all courses taken to account for all three components of the core values of USC: Scientia, Virtus, and Devotio. A student with a GPA of 1.00 to 1.20 is awarded with Summa Cum Laude Caroli Sancti which means With Highest Praise of San Carlos. A student with a GPA of 1.21 to 1.45 is awarded with Magna Cum Laude Caroli Sancti which means With Great Praise of San Carlos.

Transferees with unsatisfactory grade/s in the previous school may be considered for Latin honors, provided that he/she is enrolled in a different program in USC. However, shiftees with unsatisfactory grades in the previous program/s are disqualified from graduating with honors. A student may qualify for honors even if he/she has been underloaded for 3 units in a semester for a maximum of two semesters. The underload may also be justified if he/she is a working scholar or a varsity player or a member of the Performing Arts Group of the university.

A subsequent reduction of one rank shall be imposed for any deviation from the policies regarding an honor, including the underload incurred.


Topic 40: CHL Rationale and Aims

In view of the Mission and Vision of the University of San Carlos that aims to develop competent and socially responsible professionals and life long learners in an environment that foster excellence in the academic core processes of teaching-learning, research, and community extension service, the Carolinian Honors List (CHL) replaces the traditional Dean’s List. Those students who qualify to the Carolinian Honors List exhibit the core values of integrity, excellence, commitment, social responsibility, evangelization and leadership. The students in the CHL are assessed, determined, and selected every semester.

The CHL aims the following: 
a) identify students who embody the Carolinian identity, that of being a Witness to the Word. This identity is gauged by the three criteria of Scientia, Virtus, and Devotio. 
b) recognize students in the University who follow the Carolinian path, possess life skills and values.

Scientia refers to academic excellence where one demonstrates competence and skills in one’s chosen discipline. Virtus is good moral conduct, including active participation in school activities and student organizations. Devotio is involvement in the community extension activities outside of the University. Thus, students are encouraged to exercise citizenship in the University by participating in and getting involved in mandatory/required activities, and volunteering in community extension activities in and outside of the campus. These activities are found in the Carolinian Lifestyle Guide (CLG) and are subject to periodic changes.


Topic 41: CHL Recognition and Previleges

The Carolinian Honors is awarded every semester. Students who obtain a CHL average of at least 1.7 will be included in the Carolinian Honors List. A Certificate of Recognition will be awarded in a formal ceremony to be conducted by the School concerned. The top three (3) rank of each Cluster will be given a scholarship in the form of a tuition fee discount. The list of clusters include Architecture, Fine Arts and Design, then Arts, then sciences, then Accountancy and Economics, then Business Administration and Hospitality management, then Education, then Engineering, and Health care Professions. For each cluster, the first in rank gets a 100% tuition fee discount, the second in rank gets a 75% tuition discount, and the third in rank gets a 50% tuition fee discount. If the first in rank of each cluster is already enjoying a full scholarship either by government/private/University sponsorship, the next in line will be given the CHL scholarship. If the student has an existing University scholarship, the one with the higher privilege will be availed. If the student is enjoying a government or private partial scholarship, the CHL privilege will serve as a supplement to cover the difference in tuition fees. 

During the Commencement Rites, both the Latin Honors and Carolinian Honors will be awarded to qualified graduates. 

The GPA for the Standard Latin Honors is computed based on the final grades of all courses taken, except NSTP. A student with a GPA of 1.00 to 1.20 is awarded with Summa Cum Laude which means With Highest Praise. A student with a GPA of 1.21 to 1.45 is awarded with Magna Cum Laude which means With Great Praise. A student with a GPA of 1.46 to 1.70 is awarded with Cum Laude which means With Praise.

The GPA for the Carolinian Honors is computed based on the CHL guidelines and the final grades of all courses taken to account for all three components of the core values of USC: Scientia, Virtus, and Devotio. A student with a GPA of 1.00 to 1.20 is awarded with Summa Cum Laude Caroli Sancti which means With Highest Praise of San Carlos. A student with a GPA of 1.21 to 1.45 is awarded with Magna Cum Laude Caroli Sancti which means With Great Praise of San Carlos. A student with a GPA of 1.46 to 1.70 is awarded with Cum Laude Caroli Sancti which means With Praise of San Carlos.


Topic 42: CHL Qualification and Percentage Distribution

The following are the qualifications that the student must have in order to be considered for the CHL: 
a) not have committed any infraction within the semester and 
b) have a General Point Average of at least 1.7. 

The distribution of percentage of the components of CHL are: Scientia (70%), Virtus (15%), and Devotio (15%). The Scientia component is taken from a student’s Grade Point Average (GPA) which must be 1.7 or better. For the Virtus Component, it is evaluated through a combination of Virtus Core required activities (49%), Virtus Core voluntary activities (21%), Virtus Elective Open for all required activities (15%), Virtus Elective Open for all voluntary activities (6%), Virtus Elective Special Interest Group required activities (6%), and Virtus Elective Special Interest Group voluntary activities (3%). For the Devotio Component, it is evaluated through a combination of Devotio Core required activities (9%), Devotio Core voluntary activities (21%), Devotio Elective Open for all required activities (15%), Devotio Elective Open for all voluntary activities (34%), Devotio Elective Special Interest Group required activities (6%), and Devotio Elective Special Interest Group voluntary activities (15%).

The types of programs and activities for the students are: Core, which are essential in the formation of a Carolinian Witness to the Word, and Elective, which supplement and enrich the student’s formation as a Carolinian Witness to the Word. The types of student involvement or participation are: Required, which a student MUST attend/participate in the program/activity, and Voluntary, which a student is highly encouraged to attend/participate in any program/activity on his/her free will or choice. The types of Target Group for the Program and activities are: Open for all, which refers to all students regardless of discipline or year level, and Special interest group, which refers to certain groups for students such as varsity teams.

There are programs where activities are designed for a specific/particular year level. If a student missed the previous activities and wants to be part of the CHL, he/she can join the activity. The points for this activity shall be credited in his/her current term. There are also programs/activities that are stand-alone, meaning these are run only once in a semester/academic year. If a student misses this, he/she can no longer join this kind of program or activity. The points for stand-alone programs/activities are credited on the current semester only.


Topic 43: CHL Process and Computation

The following are the process in the generation of the Carolinian Honors List including the crediting to the accounts of the honor-students concerned.
1) The Office of the School Dean’s will submit a list of students who basically qualify for the Carolinian Honors List to the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs (OVPAA). These are the students who have a Grade Point Average of 1.0 to 1.7.
2) The list will then be forwarded by the OVPAA to the Office of Student Formation and Activities (OSFA) to screen for infractions.
3) The list, duly reviewed by OSFA, will be forwarded to the assigned members of the CHL Committee who will factor in the points for Virtus and Devotio. The points for Virtus and Devotio are based on the student’s involvement, and voluntary participation in activities inside and outside the university as categorized in the Carolinian Lifestyle Guide (CLG). Overall coordination is handled by the Presidential Assistant for Mission and Spirituality (PAMS) while the planning and implementation of the CLG activities are handled by the respective units. The data of the student’s participation will be provided by the different units who offered the programs and conducted the activities. This must be submitted not more than ten (10) days after the activity. The data from these units will be forwarded to the CHL Committee for computation. A student who was not able to participate in any Virtus or Devotio activity automatically be given a score of 0. However, a student may be given a maximum score of seventy-five (75) for an excused absence provided that necessary documents will be submitted (i.e. medical certificate). If any Virtus or Devotio activity is not implemented, a student is given a bonus score of 100.
4) When all points are factored in, the result will be checked, verified, assessed and approved by the CHL Committee before the list is submitted to the OVPAA.
5) Once the Carolinian Honors List is done, it will be posted on the bulletin board and student learning platforms for a week for students to review and react before finalization and recognition. The student can request for a clarification of the computation through the OVPAA.
6) The OVPAA will then release the final Carolinian Honors List.
7) The Office of Alumni Affairs, Scholarships and Job Placement (OAASJP) will be provided a copy for the processing of the corresponding discount-privileges of the honor students concerned.
8) The OAASJP will prepare the Credit Memo to be forwarded to the Finance Division for review.
9) After the endorsement by the Vice President for Finance, the Credit Memo will be submitted to the Office of the President for approval.
10) Once approved by the University President, the Assessment Office will be given a copy of the Credit Memo for crediting to the accounts of the honor-students concerned.


Topic 44: CHL Awards for Commencement Rites

For a student to be given the CHL award during the commencement rites, the following should be strictly observed: First, the student must have a GPA of at least 1.7 every semester, for his/her entire residency in a program. NSTP grade is excluded from the computation of the GPA. Practicum/ Internship/ OJT will be included in the computation of the GPA provided that the department considers it as an academic course and the department has obtained prior approval from the VPAA. Second, the distribution of percentage per component is 70% Scientia, 15% Virtus and 15% Devotio. Lastly, the final CHL computation for graduation honors is the average of the CHL grade of every semester.


Topic 45: Rationale of Discipline and Positive School Climate

The University of San Carlos promotes a positive school climate by making the school safe and accepting of a learning environment. A positive school climate means everyone – students, teachers, staff, parents, and community members – feels safe, welcome, and respected. Making the University safe and accepting involves the whole school and focuses on:
1. collaboratively promoting positive student behavior through a code of ethics and conduct 
2. building healthy and respectful relationships throughout the whole school community 
3. preventing inappropriate behavior through initiatives like counseling and other prevention, formation, and intervention programs. 
4. addressing inappropriate behavior through progressive and positive discipline.

The University of San Carlos is moving towards the use of positive discipline although for a long time, it has used progressive discipline and has continued to do so. Such actions as conversing with student offenders, giving them a written warning, meting out a suspension penalty from classes, and expelling them in extreme cases, are the core of progressive discipline in four steps. On the other hand, positive discipline reinforces the good behavior of students and helps them handle negative behavior in an appropriate and mature manner.

Through progressive and positive discipline, the school acknowledges that whenever students do things beneath their expected duties and responsibilities and/or behave inappropriately, it is its duty to teach, guide, mentor, and support them in the intrapersonal or interpersonal trait that they lack. It makes the students realize what behaviors are acceptable and which are not. It shows them that their choices have consequences. Thus, teaching them discipline needs earning trust, building relations, and supporting the improvement in their behavior.

The school fosters holistic character development and wellness by encouraging the students to do the right thing willfully next time due to personal enlightenment (instinct motivation) and not because of fear of sanctions (extrinsic motivation). In its application of progressive and positive discipline, it increases the students’ self-esteem and self-efficacy, developing the Virtus aspect in its motto. Virtus means being true to one’s self and to God in the practice of one’s profession and as a member of society. It also denotes responding to conscience, building up character and acting in prudence. Mirroring the evangelical attitudes, Virtus requires listening and imbibing the beatitudes of Jesus, when developed in the students, they make as their own the Carolinian identity.

Thus, as students and graduates from their respective schools of discipline, they are expected to possess the following attributes and identity: As Carolinian businessmen and economists, they are lifelong learners who continuously strive to become leading economic researchers, global leaders, entrepreneurs, and ethical professionals pushing for inclusive growth grounded on the context of Cebu, Philippines. They are socially conscious and culturally sensitive, ethical business persons who create wealth with a responsibility to share with the less fortunate and the excluded. As Carolinian designers, they possess values and professional ethics in the fair engagement with clients, colleagues, allied professionals, and the public. They are advocates for social responsibility for a just and sustainable development of the natural and built environment. As Carolinian educators, they are noble professionals who seek to uphold the integrity of the teaching profession as missionary educators witnessing to the Word. They seek to contribute to the development of educational theories and practices through functional and meaningful research. As Carolinian lawyers or political scientists, they pursue the common good under the rule of law by being able to identify and articulate legal issues, engaging in critical analysis, deciding on a reasoned alternative among several options and thinking deeply in dealing with legal issues for the first time, and getting the right responses. As Carolinian professional engineers, they are noble leaders and innovators guided by the Gospel truths as they assist society to find sustainable and appropriate solutions to local and global problems. As Carolinian scientists and artists, they are analytical, critical, open minded and innovative professionals imbued with values anchored on the common good. As advocates of the common good, they become agents of change who provide holistic perspective and integral understanding of realities.


Topic 46: Code of Conduct for Students

The Code of Conduct for Students is a set of moral standards aiding Carolinians to embody the University’s Catholic identity principles: Education with a Mission and Witness to the Word. USC aims at the holistic formation of the individual that enlightens the mind, hones skills, and positively transforms character and behavior (Society of the Divine Word, 2010). Thus, graduates of USC are professionally competent and skilled (Scientia), are value-driven and noble in character (Virtus), and are dedicated to social transformation (Devotio).

The Code of Conduct aims to develop the sensitivity of students to moral issues in contemporary life, to strengthen their courage and ability to speak out and act on these issues, and thus, to hone their sense of personal identity as Witness to the Word. Thus, each student of the University is expected to act as a mature Christian, to conduct himself/herself with dignity and deportment, and to uphold the moral standards inside and outside of the Catholic University. A code of conduct is intended to promote a wholesome atmosphere conducive to the full development of the human person in the light of Christian philosophy aligned with the USC Vision-Mission.

Academic Conduct. Students share with their teachers and academic heads the responsibility of maintaining a suitable environment that is conducive to their learning as well as classroom management by their teachers. Students perform their part in this shared responsibility by:
1) Faithfully adhering to the rules and regulations given in the Student Manual; 
2) Assuming full accountability and responsibility for their own learning and actively taking part in the learning of other students; 
3) Exerting every effort to relate what they learn in the classroom to the real world outside; 
4) Observing proper academic conduct at all times, specifically abstaining from committing plagiarism, cheating in tests or examinations, falsifying academic documents, and abetting students to do all these immoral acts; 
5) Demonstrating sensitivity to and appreciation of the facilities provided for their learning by the University by refraining from defacing, damaging, or committing wastage and theft of institutional resources.

Student - Student Relationship Conduct. As a major part of the University community, students are responsible for promoting genuine collegiality among their peers through mutual respect as well as by the example of their moral behavior. This collegiality is manifested in the following actions:
1) Respecting the rights of fellow students to learn and affording them courtesy and respect at all times; 
2) Valuing and respecting the diverse qualities and gifts of their peers, especially those of other cultures, religions, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expressions, nationalities, and social classes; 
3) Respecting each other as individuals. Under no circumstance shall they physically or psychologically harm or threaten to harm others by bullying, hazing, stalking, harassing or discriminating students in any form; 
4) Accepting constructive criticism from fellow students.

Student - Teacher Relationship Conduct. The maturity of society’s culture is assessed by the level of respect for and appreciation of its members to those who pass on to each generation the knowledge and wisdom that is its heritage. Students demonstrate this respect in the following manner:
1) Treating their teachers with the respect for the experience, knowledge, and concern they have for their welfare and learning; appropriately asking permission to use communication and information technology equipment in the classroom as a sign of respect to the teacher.
2) Actively participating and engaging in sound interaction and dialogue with their teachers and their peers without fear of intimidation; 
3) Appreciating feedback or constructive criticisms from their teachers as part of the normal process of formative education; 
4) Refraining from giving personal favors or gifts, whether in cash or in kind, in return for any special consideration such as a passing grade, the granting of honors, consideration, or other concessions; 
5) Being truthful in their reasons for not completing academic assignments, attending class, or taking an examination; 
6) Properly elevating their concern to the proper authorities like the department chairperson, dean, Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs, and/ or the President should they feel they are not given a fair and reasonable hearing on an academic matter.

Student - Administrative Relationship Conduct. Administrative employees of the University fulfill unassuming but indispensable functions in rendering support to the programs of school. Students show recognition of this important contribution by:
1) Treating administrative employees with respect and courtesy regardless of their administrative status or position; 
2) Being sensitive to the administrative employees’ schedules and workload in dealing with them; 
3) Properly elevating their concern to the administrative employee’s immediate superior should they feel they are not given a reasonable response on a particular request or dispute.

Student - University Relationship Conduct. The university environment serves and supports the mission of the institution. It must be treated with proper care and respect to ensure the health, safety, and security of members of the community. Thus, students show themselves to be socially responsible by practicing abiding by the rules and regulations:
1) They should wear their Identification Cards on campus and present the same whenever requested by University personnel. The student ID is a vital component of the University’s security system as it identifies the student as a bona fide member of the University. This constitutes a basic act of social responsibility given that campus safety and security are the responsibility of all members of the USC community. Thus, the ID is considered an official document to be treated with care and respect. It is NOT to be defaced, altered, or misused in any way, shape, or form. It is non-transferable, not lent or copied, nor discarded indiscriminately.
2) Students are required to wear the proper school uniform and/ or dress code according to the specifications and standards set by the University. Students are expected to be reasonably neat in appearance and maintain dignity in their manner of dressing, avoiding attire and decorum deemed inappropriate in a school environment. Students who intend to wear a school uniform of their preferred gender orientation must manifest their intent with the Gender and Development Section of OSFA and accomplish the Declaration Form prior to the start of the term.
3) Students are held responsible for the behavior of persons or outsiders who come into the campus on their behalf. Bodyguards or chaperones of students are not allowed inside the campus without the proper identification (ID) card issued by the OSFA and approved by the Office of Security and Safety. Even with their proper identification, bodyguards or chaperones (including drivers) are not allowed to loiter on campus. It is the student who is charged with an offense when such persons violate the Code of Conduct.
4) It is the responsibility of students to take care of school property and to help keep the university clean. Students who use or access the property of the school or of others without proper authorization shall be subjected to disciplinary measures. In case of damage to property, the student/s concerned must bear the cost of repair or replacement.
5) Students who bring vehicles into the campus should observe all campus traffic and parking regulations. This includes displaying the sticker and ensuring that their vehicles do not contribute to environmental and noise pollution.
6) Smoking is prohibited in the University premises.
7) All students share responsibility for the creation and maintenance of a healthy, safe, and drug-free campus. This includes compliance with policies and measures against bringing dangerous weapons and the use of dangerous drugs.

The following may apply for uniform exemption at OSFA prior to the start of the term: Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), Students with Special Medical Needs, Different Sexual Orientation as indicated in the declaration of orientation, Cultural Considerations, Working students for gainful employment, Married students, Pregnant Women, Cross-Enrollees, Second Coursers, On-the-Job Training (Internship)

Student and Community Relationship Conduct. In immersing themselves in community-related activities, the students should bear in mind that they represent the institution’s interest and involvement in establishing rapport with and support of community members. For these purposes, the students are expected to:
1) participate in community services and extracurricular activities by making active use of the knowledge and skills they have gained at the university; 
2) support the activities of other sectors, such as civil society, government, and parochial and religious organizations; 
3) behave responsibly in the use of communication and information technology, especially when engaging in any action that may impact the privacy, dignity, and/or rights of institutions, groups or individuals, including themselves.
4) conduct themselves properly and use the name of the University during off-campus activities, especially those that are cultural and educational in nature. Students should bear in mind that any of their off-campus activities should not directly or indirectly tarnish the name of the school, especially the values and principles it stands for. Students officially representing the University or any of its recognized or official sectors or units in activities involving external groups must obtain official approval from a person of authority or from the concerned department or office.
5) refrain from involving the University in their own personal financial dealings; conduct themselves at all times in such a way as not to cast aspersion or bring dishonor and discredit to the University or tarnish its good name and reputation. In this regard, the students should understand that the University has the right and authority to regulate their conduct and activities on or off campus when these conduct and activities affect the good order and welfare of the University or have a direct and immediate effect on the discipline or general welfare of the school. Creating fictitious account that does not carry the real name of the student but can be identified as a Carolinian is prohibited.

Netiquette for Carolinians. While social media platforms are avenue for communication and expression of learning, responsible Carolinians should be mindful of the proper conduct and use of these resources. Learners are expected to observe proper ethical values, be culturally sensitive and conscious of the risks associated with plagiarism, cyberbullying, use of abusive language and other related actions that are against the ethical and moral standards that will have a negative impact on their holistic formation and university reputation.
1) Attend an online activity properly groomed.
2) Be on time. It is highly suggested to come 10 minutes before the time to check if the equipment/gadgets work. 
3) Be respectful. When typing messages, avoid using all caps, exclamation points or enlarging fonts for emphasis. These are all equivalent to shouting. 
4) Be mindful of the grammar and spelling. 
5) Be polite. Address people properly. Do not interrupt when another person is talking. 
6) Be considerate when making remarks. Use appropriate language.
7) Choose a place where there is no distraction. 
8) Once the activity has started, be attentive to the speaker for the entire period and be participative.

Topic 48: Progressive and Positive Discipline Policy

Discipline in schools is specifically mandated by the Constitution, which says "that all educational institutions shall teach the rights and duties of citizenship, strengthen ethical and spiritual values, develop moral character and personal discipline."

The Constitution requires all schools to be responsible in shaping the behavior of young people under their care. The framing of rules governing university-student relations, particularly on student discipline, is vital, not merely to the smooth and efficient operation of the institution, but to its very survival.

USC adapts a progressive and positive discipline policy. Through progressive and positive discipline, it acknowledges that whenever the student does things below his/her expected duties and responsibilities and/or behaves inappropriately, it is the duty of the whole school to discipline the student(s) by teaching, guiding, mentoring, and supporting an intrapersonal/interpersonal skill that a particular student lacks. It also lets them realize what behaviors are acceptable and/or appropriate and what behaviors are not. It is also showing them that their choices have consequences. Thus, teaching discipline needs trust, building relations, supporting students to improve their behavior and, hopefully, preventing inappropriate student behavior from happening again.

Punishment is only one technique of discipline and expulsion is reserved as a measure of last resort. On the other hand, employing alternative programs and practices that support student needs and hold students accountable, yet keep them engaged in the classroom, is highly encouraged because this leads to higher achievement and improved graduation rates.

More importantly, a progressive and positive discipline policy must adhere to the core values of the university. School policies and discipline recommendations must encourage academic learning and not hamper or impede academic engagement (Scientia); promote holistic character development and wellness by encouraging the student to do the right thing next time willfully due to personal enlightenment (intrinsic motivation) and not because of fear of sanction (extrinsic motivation) and by increasing then decreasing a student’s self-esteem and self-efficacy (Virtus); and contribute to developing a student’s altruistic and prosocial attitude/behavior, and/ or cultural sensitivity through service orientation (Devotio).

Thus, in using a progressive and positive discipline, the following should be taken into consideration and amidst careful deliberation: 1) The students’ stage of growth and development. 2) The nature, severity, and frequency of the offense/ inappropriate behavior. 3) The history and circumstances surrounding it. 4) The impact of the behavior on the school climate.

Within this context, more serious consequences may be considered for inappropriate behavior that escalates or is repeated. Providing students with the opportunity to reflect on their own actions and the impact of these actions is essential to student learning. A student’s behavior occurs in a broader context and can be changed over time. Thus, each decision on discipline is unique for each student. It will depend on the strengths and challenges of that student.

Therefore, a range of options to determine the most appropriate way to respond to each situation and help the student learn from his or her choices is considered. Depending on the case, the support or consequences will be given by the different persons of authority as follows but not limited to the student development mentors, teachers, Department Chairs, Deans, OSFA Officers, Vice Presidents, and/or the President.

The discipline recommendations will include different supports and consequences. Supports could include:
1) A discipline conversation with the student by either one or more of the following persons but not limited to the Student Development Mentors, Teachers, Guidance Counselors, Campus Priests and Ministers, Department Chairs, Deans, OSFA Officers, Vice Presidents, and/or President; 
2) A parent - teacher/staff feedback and conferences by either one or more of the following persons but not limited to the student development mentors, teachers, guidance counselors, campus priests and ministers, Department Chairs, Dean, OSFA Officers, Vice Presidents, and/or the President; 
3) A review of expectations for the student’s behavior conducted by either one or more of the following persons but not limited to the Student Development Mentors, Teachers, Guidance Counselors, Campus Priests and Ministers, Department Chairs, Deans, OSFA Officers, Vice Presidents, and/or President. 
4) Formation sessions like counseling, moral and/or spiritual guidance, coaching, anger management, etc.; 
5) Attending prevention and/or intervention programs.

Consequences could include the following, depending on the gravity of the offense:
1) Writing a personal apology to the aggrieved/offended party; 
2) Doing an academic assignment or writing a paper; 
3) Mandatory work in the form of community service; 
4) Suspension, disqualification, or withdrawal of privileges (e.g., uniform exemptions, grant of car sticker, discounts, scholarships, etc.); 
5) Payment of the value of the property destroyed/damaged /lost or its replacement;

10) Conditional or non-issuance of certificate of good moral character; 
11) Payment of fines;

13) Mandatory psychological/clinical assessment and compliance with the recommendations of an accredited specialist; 
14) Restriction against participation in school activities/further contact with aggrieved parties; 
15) Outright dismissal;

Minor to less serious offenses are handled by the student development mentors (SDMs). SDM(s) is a (are) faculty member(s) assigned in each department who is (are) in-charged in mentoring their students’ development and discipline. SDMs can only recommend certain support, sanctions, and penalties and needs approval by their respective academic chairperson. 

There are some minor to less serious offenses that will be handled by the Student Development Committee (SDEVCOM) members when it involves cases between departments of the same college. SDEVCOM can only recommend certain support, sanctions, and penalties and needs approval by their respective academic dean. 

Serious to very serious offenses are reported to the campus Student Discipline Officer (SDO). After an initial assessment and evaluation, the campus SDO may recommend for the SDMs and/or SDEVCOM to handle the case or endorse it, and then convene the Student Discipline Committee. 

The Student Discipline Committee (SDC) is a body tasked to discuss and deliberate on the discipline recommendation of a case. It is composed of the head of the OSFA, a university lawyer, and a member ofthe student development board. The SDC can only recommend support, sanctions, and penalties. The recommendation will be acted upon by the Director of Student Services and approved by the Vice President concerned. In the conduct of its investigation, SDC will not adopt a trial-type proceeding. Cross-examination may be disallowed at its discretion. 

The Vice President concerned (dependent on whether the case is academic, property and safety, and/or financial in nature) decides and approves the recommendations endorsed by the Director of Student Affairs and Services Office regarding disciplinary matters. The VP’s decision on a student disciplinary case is final and can be executed through the Student Discipline Office.


Topic 50: Categories and Ranking of Offenses

A. Minor Offense 
Minor violations do not involve serious injury or harm, lack evidence of malice or premeditation, behaviors can be attributed to development or circumstances, and have little or no serious negative implications for the University or its members. Minor offenses are recorded in a student’s name, but do not prevent him/her from receiving a clean Certificate of Good Moral Character. Although still recorded, the frequency of offense is refreshed every semester. Repeated minor violations in a semester, however, may constitute a basis for the filing of a higher rank offense. Minor offenses are given three (3) warnings: 
- First warning constitutes a Discipline Consultative Session (in accordance with our "Sultihi ako, maminaw ako" Program-Consultative Session/s).
- Second warning, the Student is now required to submit an apology letter before his/her school ID is returned. A strong warning is given to the student during the Discipline Consultative Session.
- Third warning serves as the Final Warning. The student is now informed of the consequences of his/her actions with varied sanctions according to the gravity of the offense committed.

All teachers, school officials, and other university employees and persons in authority may call the attention of the student who committed a minor offense. Depending on the frequency and the school of the student(s) involved, minor offenses are handled by the Student Development Mentors (SDMs) and by the Student Development Committee (SDEVCOM) members.
First offense - Discipline Conversation (Oral Warning) 
Second Offense - Discipline Conversation (Written Warning is given after which the student is required to make a written reply.) 
Third Offense - Discipline Conversation. See other disciplinary support & consequences. (Written Reply).

B. Less Serious Offense
Less serious offenses are acts that disrupt the order and are a threat to the security and safety of the school. A less serious offense does minimal physical injury and minimal harm to the honor and dignity of others but has no serious negative implication for the University or its members. Less serious offenses are recorded in a student’s name but do not prevent them from receiving a clean Certificate of Good Moral Character. Although still recorded, the frequency of offense is refreshed every academic year. Repeated less serious offenses in an academic year, however, may constitute a basis for the filing of a higher rank offense. 

All teachers, school officials, and other university employees and persons in authority may call the attention of the student who committed a less serious offense. Depending on the frequency and the school of the student(s) involved, less serious offenses are handled by the Student Development Mentors (SDMs) and by the Student Development Committee (SDEVCOM) members. First offense 
First offense - Discipline Conversation. Written Warning is given to the student and required to submit a written reply. 
Second offense - Written Warning is given to the student and required to submit a written reply.
Third offense - Written Warning is given to the student and required to submit a written reply.

C. Serious Offense. 
Serious offenses are acts that do a greater threat or damage to the safety, property, honor, and dignity of another person and the school.

Repeated serious offenses, however, may constitute a basis for the filing of a higher rank offense. 

All teachers, school officials, and other university employees and persons in authority may call the attention of the student who committed a serious offense. Serious offenses are handled by the campus student discipline office (SDO). After an initial assessment and evaluation, the campus SDO may recommend for the SDMs and/or SDEVCOM to handle the case or endorse it, and then convene the Student Discipline Committee.
For all offenses: Discipline Conversation (Written Reply). The chair, the dean, and the Parents/Guardians are informed. The Student Discipline Committee convened. See other disciplinary support & consequences. Written Warning is given to the student and required to submit a written reply.

D. Very Serious Offense.

A student organization is an organized group of students sharing common interests, objectives, philosophy, and operational activities not contrary to laws, morals and University rules and regulations. Furthermore, a student organization must be non-partisan, non-political in all political exercises (within and outside the university). Such formation of student organizations is regarded by the University as a healthy sign of growing social awareness and concern and as an exercise of students’ freedom of association. This freedom, however, entails the responsibility to respect the freedom of others and to uphold the dignity of the student body as a whole. The University therefore, recognizes the student organizations as among the venues for: 
1) the development of students’ talents, potentials and capabilities; 
2) students’ greater awareness of their rights, duties and responsibilities; 
3) wholesome social and recreational activities;
4) the realization of the university’s mission statement and academic aims.

The student organizations are broadly categorized into two, namely: 
1) Co-curricular – which are school/department-based and whose membership is automatic upon enrollment in a particular course or college. 
2) Extra-curricular - which are initiated and organized by students to accommodate specific interests, concerns or visions, e.g. socio-civic, cultural, religious, athletic, professional service clubs, etc. and whose membership is voluntary.

To complement and enhance the learning process, students are allowed to initiate and organize activities which may be co-curricular or extra-curricular in nature. Schools, departments, and student organizations, in coordination with the Office of Student Formation and Activities (OSFA), manage these activities. The activities must be held within the academic calendar, and should not be scheduled a week before and during major examinations and institutional celebrations unless the activities are intrinsically related therewith.

Registration and Supervision: The Student Activities Officer shall have general supervision of all activities of registered student organizations as well as the student body. All student organizations, including the Supreme and School Student Councils, shall register or renew their registration at OSFA at the beginning of the school year, per CMO 9, series of 2013 (Article VIII, Section 21) and CMO 8, series of 2021. They shall accomplish the requirements asstated in the Student Organization Manual. Among others, the said requirements are the Constitution and/or By-laws or its equivalent, Program of Activities Form, Officers’ and Faculty Adviser’s Data Sheet, list of members and endorsements of authorized university officers or mother clubs for affiliated organizations. Upon compliance with the aforementioned requirements, student organizations shall then be entitled to official recognition by the University through OSFA.

Frequently asked questions regarding student organizations:

Many of the Officers in my organization are no longer returning. What is the process to be followed for appointing or electing officers for student organizations? Check your Constitution and By-Laws for the appointment or election procedures. If it is not feasible to follow through, the suggestion is to function with the human resources you have for as long as the goals of the organization can be met. If the goals cannot be met, the suggestion is to reduce the goals to only its most essential in carrying out the purpose of the organization. All student organizations, recognized or unrecognized by the Office of Student Affairs, are recognized by USC-SSC with no rigorous requirements through the Conglomeration of Student Organizations (CSO). You will be assisted as soon as organization-related problems are present and noticed. You may ask for assistance from USC-SSC for meeting the goals of your organization. 

How can student organizations collect funds? For Co-curricular Organizations, you may request for your fees to be included in the collection reflected on ISMIS through your Department. For Extracurricular Organizations, you may employ your prefered method of collection. For School Councils, upon coordination with the Dean, you have access to fees that may already be included in the semestral fees of the students (e.g. for SAS Council, previously "SAS Program Activities Fee"). The suggestion is to first plan out your Calendar of Activities and then determine the most considerate budget possible as to not burden the students with more fees.	


Topic 58: Educational Tours and Field Trips

In the context of learning, students are provided with the opportunity to augment classroom learning through out-of-classroom activities. These activities are governed by CMO 63, series of 2017 (Policies and Guidelines of Local Off-Campus Activities), and CMO 01, series of 2023 (Amendment of Article IV.E of the earlier mentioned CMO) to ensure security and safety of students during the conduct of the activities; thus, they shall file an application at the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Student organizations shall apply at the Office of Student Formation and Activities. In some cases, international trips may be allowed and CMO 26, series of 2015 shall govern and apply. The above-mentioned guidelines are subject to updates that may be provided by CHED.


Topic 59: Student Support and Services Quality Policy

The University of San Carlos has an ISO 9001:2015 that established and certified a quality management system for the provision of student support services for student welfare, student development, and institutional student programs.
