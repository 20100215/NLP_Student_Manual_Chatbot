If there are no more slots for a major course offered by your department, reach out to your program coordinator. We also request the affected students to be patient as the coordinators have to consider the classroom and teacher availability before being able to open another class group for a particular course. Note that during adjustment period, classes with insufficient students will be dissolved so the extra needed groups may be held in those timeslots instead.
