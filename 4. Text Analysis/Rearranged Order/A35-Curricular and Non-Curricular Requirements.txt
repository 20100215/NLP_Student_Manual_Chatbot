Topic 35: Curricular and Non-Curricular Requirements

A student enrolled in a bachelor’s or associate program is considered full-time if he/she carries a regular load prescribed in his/her curriculum for a given time. The curricular year of a student is determined by the number of units earned in the curriculum of his/her program. The course load and sequence of courses shall be in accordance with the approved curriculum. Reasonable exceptions may be permitted in individual cases taking into account the best interest of the students and the objectives of the curriculum as determined by the School Dean or Department Chair. No course(s) can be taken ahead of its/their pre-requisite(s); otherwise, it/they shall be nullified and taken again even if the student is graduating. Laboratory courses should be taken with the corresponding lecture courses in the same semester even though separate grades are earned. In case of withdrawal of co-requisites, both courses should be withdrawn together. A failed co-requisite course can be re-enrolled without re-enrolling the other course the student has passed. All curricular policies, including the sequence of courses, apply to transferees and shiftees. They should not be given preference for override of prerequisites and not opening of off-semester courses. Upon admission, the Chair should inform the students of the number of courses that they can enroll in, especially if some courses need prerequisites. The option for tutorial or petition may be provided for an off-semester course but in no case shall the regular students be allowed to join in and take the course in advance.

Course Adjustments

Application for the following course adjustments is in ISMIS:
OVERLOAD. A student may have an overload of not more than six (6) units in excess of the regular load under the following conditions: 
- graduating at the end of the year; has not incurred more than five (5) failures (a grade of 5.0) in those terms that he/she was enrolled at the university 
- grade point average (GPA) is at least 2.8. In computing the GPA, grades of 5.0 and NC are included. - the excess course(s) is/are not prerequisites. Repeated courses due to failures may be taken as overload if recommended by the Department Chair and the School Dean, and approved by the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA). The overload may be spread in the last two terms.
Overload is not allowed for non-graduating students.

SIMULTANEOUS ENROLLMENT. A student may be allowed to enroll in the pre-requisite course and the advanced course simultaneously in order to graduate during his/her final term. This privilege is restricted to only a particular two-subject load. Simultaneous enrollment involving three or more advanced courses taken together with corresponding prerequisites are not allowed. If the student fails in the prerequisite(s), he/she would have to retake all the advanced courses affected and the enrollment for the advanced courses automatically becomes null and void. Failure in the prerequisite course invalidates the advanced course enrolled simultaneously. Simultaneous enrollment of an advanced major course with a failed prerequisite course may be allowed starting on the third year of a four-year program and on the fourth year of a five-year program.

PETITIONED/TUTORIAL COURSES. Students may request for the opening of a course as a petitioned or tutorial class (lecture) subject to the following conditions: 
- it is an off-semester course
- it is a prerequisite course for the next semester offering 
- it is the only course left for the students to graduate at the end of the term 
- there should be at least six (6) students for the petitioned course and five (5) students or less for the tutorial course 
- a laboratory course can only be requested as a petitioned course.

OVERRIDE COURSES. The override rule due to an INC grade of a prerequisite course in favor of an advanced course may be allowed in the last academic year prior to graduation. It may also be allowed for a subsequent course that requires Internship/Practicum as a requisite in case the student is still completing the said Internship/ Practicum (i.e., number of hours required).

Accreditation of Courses. Accreditation should be on the basis of equivalence in course content and level of instruction. Units earned in non-degree programs may be considered for accreditation to a degree program and limited to general education subjects, and if necessary, the student should be subjected to validating examinations. Necessary precautions should be taken in the case of foreign students in accrediting units earned abroad. Furthermore, accreditation of courses shall be based on the curriculum of the programs, in particular, the topic coverage, and the number of units earned or contact hours. It should be accomplished within the enrollment period upon admission to the University through ISMIS, supported by a copy of the official or informative transcript of records signed by the School Registrar or by an official authority, not the grade slips. Accreditation is subject to the following terms and conditions:

For earned units and credits taken from higher education institutions:
- Earned units to be accredited shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total required academic units of the degree program for graduation.
- Only professional courses taken from PAASCU Level III accredited degree programs may be requested for accreditation.
- General Education Courses with a final grade of 2.5 (B- = 80%) or higher can be accredited if taken from PAASCU-accredited degree programs and a final grade of 2.0 (B+ = 85%) or higher if taken from non-PAASCU accredited degree programs. General Education courses taken prior to 2018-2019 are not credited except for Rizal and NSTP. 
- Validating Examinations shall be administered by the Course Chair to students who do not meet the required final grade. 
- Course description and official copy of the transcript of records (TOR) duly signed by the school registrar shall be the bases for accreditation and not grade slips or print-out of grades. For enrollment purposes, the informative copy of the transcript of records would suffice.
- The approved accreditation of courses is subject to revocation if the records upon which the approval is based are later found to be incorrect.

For earned units and credits taken abroad:
- Earned units to be accredited shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total required academic units of the degree program for graduation. 
- Only collegiate courses with a final grade of 2.0 (B = 85%) or higher can be accredited. 
- Validating Examinations shall be administered by the Course Chair to students who do not meet the required final grade and/ or the required units of the course. The approved accreditation of courses is subject to revocation if the records upon which the approval is based are later found to be incorrect.

For earned units and credits in non-degree programs: 
- Only General education Courses taken in AY 2018-2019 onwards with a final grade of 2.5 (B- = 80%) or higher can be accredited if taken from PAASCU accredited degree programs and a final grade of 2.0 (B = 85%) or higher if taken from non-PAASCU accredited degree programs. 
- Validating Examinations shall be administered by the Subject Chairman to students who do not meet the required final grade.
The approved accreditation of courses is subject to revocation if the records upon which the approval is based are later found to be incorrect.

Residency. The student is expected to complete the program within the period specified in the program. The student may avail of the Maximum Allowable Residency (MAR) that is equal to the required number of years to complete the course multiplied by 1.5. This covers the conduct of research/ thesis as part of the program requirement. The admission of students who go beyond MAR is subject to deliberation by the Department/School. It may be a cause for non-readmission.

Leave of Absence. A student who does not intend to enroll during the following semester is required to file a leave of absence for a maximum of one (1) year prior to its effectivity. He/she writes a letter to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, duly endorsed by the Department Chair and School Dean, with a declaration that he/she shall not enroll in any other school for the duration of the leave. Documents such as doctor’s advice for medical reasons may be attached to justify the leave. The approved Leave of Absence copy shall be part of the student’s permanent record in the Office of the University Registrar. An official Leave of Absence is not counted in the Maximum Allowable Residency (MAR) and does not affect the residency of the student who is vying for graduation honors. Failure to file a leave of absence shall have the following effects: 
- The period covered by the student’s absence shall continue to be counted towards his/her Maximum Allowable Residency (MAR). 
- If a new curriculum is implemented during the absence, he/she shall be required to follow the new curriculum on his/her return. 
- The student’s readmission shall be subject to terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Department/School. 
- A student shall be disqualified to graduate with honors since a continuous enrollment is a requirement.

Examinations. Besides regular class quizzes, tests, and other requirements, four (4) official general examinations are required to be given every term: pre-midterm, mid-term, pre-final, and final examinations. Dates for these examinations are posted on USC’s official website. Faculty members are provided with the examination schedule for their information and guidance.

Students are advised to check their grades through their ISMIS account, print the grades, and keep a copy in a folder together with other important documents ready for reference on occasions such as advising, enrollment, graduation, and other activities when evidence of academic performance is needed. The University is authorized to withhold access to grades of students who may have an academic deficiency, are undergoing disciplinary sanction, or have unsettled financial obligations.
