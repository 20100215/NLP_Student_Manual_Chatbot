Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering / BS Chemical Engineeeing / BS ChE

Description:
Chemical engineers play significant roles in the conceptualization of a new or improved product and the process to manufacture it as well as in the development, design, operation, and improvement of those processes. The Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering (BS ChE) program aims to build competencies needed in collaborative investigation and solution of complex process problems and in making ethical, professional decisions that minimize cost and impact to health, safety and environment. The program begins with students acquiring foundational knowledge on natural sciences and mathematics, holistic understanding, civic competencies, and skills to use basic engineering tools. Students then undergo learning experiences that enable them for chemical engineering analysis and design in collaborative teams. In the final year, students are required to demonstrate abilities for analysis, synthesis, design, research, communication and interpersonal skills through team-based capstone projects on chemical process and product design, research-based thesis, and industry internship.

The Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering (BS ChE) builds competencies for these jobs: Process engineers, Product engineers, Production manager/supervisors, Manufacturing operations engineer, Plant managers, Pollution control officer, Safety engineers, Quality assurance engineer, Process design engineers, Product development engineers, Patent engineers, Research and development engineer, Engineering consultants, Technical sales engineer, Environmental management specialists, Technical advisers, Technopreneurs
