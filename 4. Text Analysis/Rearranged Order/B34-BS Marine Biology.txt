Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology / BS Marine Biology / BS M BIO

Description:
Marine Biology, as a discipline, finds its role in the creation of human resource that will steward the vast marine resources of the Philippines, which has the 5th longest coastline in the world (36,289 Kilometers) and strategically located in the heart of the Coral Triangle. More importantly, the Philippinesâ€™ global recognition as the marine resource in food, medicine, tourism, materials, energy, climate, security and pharmaceuticals should be acknowledged. The Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology (BS M BIO) program aims to develop graduates that will have a clear recognition and understanding of the dynamics of the marine life and its ecosystem through actual field or hands-on experience which will provide the foundations for future careers in marine biology, conservation, oceanography, biomedicine, molecular biology, university teaching, fisheries, etc.
