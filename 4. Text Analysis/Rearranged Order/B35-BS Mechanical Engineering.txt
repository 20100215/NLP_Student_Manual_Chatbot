Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering / BS Mechanical Engineering / BS ME

Description:
The Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BS ME) begins with the study of the behavior of materials upon the application of forces and/or heat manifested by moving things. Anything that is mechanical or interacts with another machine or human being is within the broad scope of mechanical engineering. The core and professional courses enable students to acquire useful skills that can gain national or international certifications. These help students go through capstone courses of Power Plant Design, Industrial Plant Design, and Machine Design. To give the students a culminating experience, community-based research is required prior to a whole semester of on-the-job training before graduation. Graduates of the program are capable of designing and operating space vehicles, power plants, intelligent machines and robots, automobiles, trains, airplanes, furnaces, and air-conditioners. They can work on jet engine design, submarines, hot air balloons, advanced materials, hospital equipment, refrigerators, air-conditioners, and other machineries.
