Topic 55: Jurisdiction

The USC Administration, through the Office of Student Formation and Activities â€“ Student Discipline Section, has jurisdiction over all cases involving the discipline of students. A student who is charged with an offense, and refuses to heed the summons to appear before the investigating body set up by the administration is deemed to have waived his/her right to present evidence/s. The case shall then be decided based on the complaint and the evidence/is presented. Misconduct committed outside the University, consequently affecting his/her status as a student, is covered with the policy on discipline. In case of subsequent enrollment of such a student, he/she will have to answer the charges filed and lodged against him/her.
