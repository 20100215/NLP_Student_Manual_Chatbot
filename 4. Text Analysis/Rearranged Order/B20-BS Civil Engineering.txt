Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering / BS Civil Engineering / BS CH

Description:
In addition to conscious motivation, the Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (BS CE) program is a 4.5 year program that requires good knowledge of basic calculus and sciences— both natural and physical—so that students, along with the outcomes-based method of teaching and learning, can wade through the streams of higher mathematics and core courses that serve as foundation in gaining the ability to: calculate forces that act upon horizontal and vertical structures; analyze the effects of forces and response of structures; determine the properties and behavior of construction materials; estimate the quantity and cost of materials for construction; determine water velocity and flow rates either in pipes or open channels; and estimate flow velocity, flow rates and volumes in rivers and natural waterways. The program, through the professional and elective courses, trains the students to: design horizontal and vertical structures; manage construction projects and design water supply systems, flood protection, and control structures; perform land development planning and consultancy, and work as part of a team.

The Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (BS CE) builds competencies for these jobs: Project managers / project engineers, Construction managers / construction engineers, Quantity surveyors, Water resources engineers, Geotechnical engineers, Structural designers

The core courses for BS Civil Engineering (BS CE) are: Civil Engineering Orientation, Engineering Calculus, Engineering Data Analysis, Engineering Economics, Engineering Management, Chemistry for Engineers, Physics for Engineers, Computer Programming, Engineering Drawing and Plans, Computer-Aided Drafting, Fundamentals of Surveying, Statics of Rigid Bodies, Dynamics of Rigid Bodies, Mechanics of Deformable Bodies, Engineering Utilities
