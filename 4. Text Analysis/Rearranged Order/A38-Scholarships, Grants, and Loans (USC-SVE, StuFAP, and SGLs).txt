Topic 38: Scholarship, Grants, and Loans

General Guidelines of the Scientia, Virtus, and Devotio Student Financial Assistance Program: The University provides scholarship grants to students characterized by either of the following: scholastic excellence, membership in the USC varsity teams and the USC performing arts groups, and financial status as supported by pertinent documents. Scholarships are likewise afforded to deserving students who meet the requirements of alumni associations, government, and private scholarship benefactors. The scholarship program at USC consists of those sponsored by the University, Alumni, Government, and Private Entities. 

Thus, consistent with the National Government’s thrust (per Uni-FAST Act) and the University Administration's directions, according to the type of Student Financial Assistance, the nomenclatures of student financial assistance privileges are now being rationalized to reflect advocacy of the University’s identity principle "Education with a Mission" and practice of the Carolinians' motto of "Scientia, Virtus & Devotio as provided in the following categories."

Scholarships according to Type of Student Financial Assistance Program (StuFAP):
- Scholarship (Merit/Scientia) – emphasizes excellent academic performance, athletic skills (for Varsity Players), and artistic talents (for the Performing Arts Group, i.e., USC Choristers, USC Dance Troupe & Theater Guild). 
- Grant-in-Aid (Non-Merit/Devotio) – the emphasis is on the long term difficult financial status and needs of the student beneficiary’s family. 
- Loan (Devotio) – considers the financial need at the moment, regardless of the financial status of the student beneficiary’s family.

Scholarships according to Sponsor are the University, SVD-Individuals, Alumni, Faculty Members, USC SSC, Government, and Industry and Private Entities. Scholarships according to levels of education are Graduate, Tertiary, Basic Education, and Senior High School.

As a general rule, scholarship grantees are not allowed multiple scholarships at any given time. But, if there are those qualifying for two are entitled only to the scholarship with the higher financial grant upon the endorsement of the Alumni Affairs, Scholarship and Job Placement Office. However, those who are beneficiaries of a scholarship grant funded by other agencies or by private individuals are entitled to a USC tuition fee discount privilege due to them because of scholastic excellence, i.e., Carolinian Honors List and membership in varsity teams and performing arts groups recognized by the University.

Applicants may inquire about available scholarships and secure forms from the Alumni Affairs, Scholarship and Job Placement Office or Coordinators/Advisers. Scholarship applicants must properly complete forms and specific requirements for submission within the official registration period. Applicants can also inquire the program coordinators and department chairs via email for possible scholarships that are offered for their respective programs (e.g. For Applied Math - Dr. Katrina E. Belleza-Fuentes - kebelleza@usc.edu.ph)
