Bachelor of Science in Biology / BS Biology / BS BIO

Description:
Biology, as an academic discipline, has been broadened and diversified with the development of advanced laboratory equipment and sophisticated techniques in collaboration with chemists, physicists and engineers. This has led to a dynamic development of research in all levels of biological complexity from molecules to ecosystems, where their properties and interactions are analyzed. The Bachelor of Science in Biology (BS BIO) program is structured as a generalized framework of study with the end of view of grounding students in the fundamental concepts, principles, and theories of the biological, natural and physical sciences, and the conduct of research. This includes the acquisition of appropriate skills, and training in the efficient processing and presentation of information in both written and oral forms.

The Bachelor of Science in Biology (BS BIO) builds competencies for these jobs: Biologists, Resource Managers, Microbiologists, Food Safety Officers, Project Development Officers, Laboratory Managers, Science Research Specialists
