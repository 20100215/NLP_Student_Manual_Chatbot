Thanatology (Philosophy of Dying and Death)
Thanatology is a three-unit course that enables students to examine into some core issues of human existence such as death, dying and the meaning and value of life. We will probe on how our attitudes on the subject of death and dying affect and influence our lives. Questions of life and death and how they connect with our choices and responsibilities, our understanding of ourselves as mortal beings, and our vision of what constitutes a good life (and maybe a good death) will be explored. Some key philosophical teachings will be used as primary sources as well as some relevant articles and literatures from other disciplines on the topic will be considered to make this course interdisciplinary.

The Just Society and the Market (GE-FEL JSM)
One of the earliest conceptions of justice -giving oneâ€™s due- is entangled with the process of distribution and exchange of resources necessary for the flourishing of human life. The apparatus that has this process for its function is the market. The relation between justice and the market, therefore, is as intertwined as human life is to human society. This course will examine the connection between the market and the question of justice. Thus, this course will primarily proceed in a diachronic manner that will show the deep historical development of the relation between the two that will bring to fore philosophical, economical, sociological and theological concepts that inform this development, from the concept of needs and labour, the question of distributive justice and the fair allocation of resources, the morality of profit, the basis of property, to the notions of liberty, equality, equity, international solidarity and even the Christian idea of the Charity. The examination of this deep historical development will bring to light pressing contemporary global issues. Ultimately, this course demonstrate that these contemporary global issues, both pressing and serious, will find their proper context in the study of the relation between the market and the idea of justice.

Caring for our Environment: Human Development and the Ethics of Sustainability (GE-FEL CEHDES)
The course will explore the ethical issues arising from the relationship between man and the natural environment. Development is a highly contested concept. What do we mean when we say development? Should we construe the term in purely economic terms? The course will tie this concept to human development as it is understood by two important development theorists, namely, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. By doing so, we enhance the meaning of this notion which could be used as a model in and as a basis for public policy and governance for the advancement of human welfare and the protection of the natural environment. There is a tension between the concept of development and caring for the environment. Development, if it is understood as unlimited economic growth could be fatal to efforts in environmental protection and management. In order to thwart the peril brought about by this notion of development, there is a need to examine and reconceived this notion so as not to endanger the natural environment and compromise the welfare of the future generation.
